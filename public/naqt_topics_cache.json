    "content": "Miss Havisham (Great Expectations) is the cold, cruel resident of Satis House, whom Pip (the novel’s protagonist) begins to visit as a child. Miss Havisham’s life is defined by a single event: her jilting by a man named Compeyson. Ever since she was abandoned on her wedding day, she has worn nothing but her wedding dress and a single shoe (since she had only put on the one when she learned of Compeyson’s betrayal), keeps all the clocks in the house permanently set to 8:40 (the precise minute she learned of the betrayal), and has left her untouched wedding cake on the table (now rotting and covered with cobwebs). Miss Havisham has an adopted ward named Estella, whom she conditions to never truly love anyone, with the goal that Estella will, by proxy, take Miss Havisham’s revenge on men. When Estella breaks Pip’s heart by marrying his rival Bentley Drummle, Miss Havisham realizes that she has hurt Pip in the way she herself was hurt and repents, only to die when her wedding dress accidentally catches fire.\n\nAbel Magwitch (Great Expectations) is first encountered by Pip when Pip is a child and Magwitch is an escaped convict who threatens Pip with death if Pip does not bring him food and a means to free himself from his chains. Pip does so, but Magwitch is still captured and sent to Australia. When Pip learns years later that someone has sent money for his education as a gentleman, he assumes it is Miss Havisham; he learns much later that Magwitch is actually his secret benefactor, having become rich in Australia after serving his sentence. Magwitch secretly returns to England to meet Pip; Pip is at first repulsed by him, but eventually comes to care for him, helping prevent Magwitch from being caught by English authorities. Magwitch is revealed to be both Estella’s father and a criminal associate of Compeyson (the man who jilted Miss Havisham).\n\nFagin (Oliver Twist) is often described as Dickens’ most vehemently anti-Semitic character: he is introduced as “a very old shrivelled Jew” with a “villainous-looking and repulsive face,” and Dickens often simply refers to him as “the Jew” (though he did tone down the book’s more overt anti-Semitism after receiving a letter from Jewish reader Eliza Davis). Fagin commands a gang of pickpockets made up of orphaned boys whom he has trained as thieves; Oliver Twist is introduced to Fagin by one of Fagin’s pickpockets known as the Artful Dodger. Fagin’s attempt to train Oliver as one of his pickpockets, however, fails; Oliver is simply too honest to complete a criminal act. Fagin’s associates include the criminal Bill Sikes and a man named Monks, the latter of whom is actually Oliver’s half-brother and who had conspired with Fagin to try and steal Oliver’s inheritance. Fagin is eventually arrested and sentenced to death; Oliver visits him on the last night before his execution, upon which Fagin’s fear of death prompts him to hopelessly fantasize about a scenario in which Oliver helps him escape his fate.\n\nBill Sikes (Oliver Twist) is a cruel, vicious burglar and associate of Fagin, who is relentlessly abusive to both his girlfriend Nancy, whom he pimps out, and his dog, Bull’s-eye. Fagin assigns Sikes to abduct and return Oliver after Oliver is caught during a failed pickpocketing; Oliver is subsequently sent to accompany Sikes on a robbery, during which Oliver is hurt and left behind once more. Out of guilt over her role in Oliver’s troubles, Nancy begins to secretly pass on information to the people now caring for Oliver. Fagin learns of this, and informs Sikes; Sikes subsequently beats Nancy to death. Sikes attempts to drown Bull’s-eye and flee London, but Bull’s-eye finally escapes, and—while attempting to climb down from a roof using a rope—Sikes hallucinates Nancy’s eyes staring at him, falls, and accidentally hangs himself.\n\nJames Steerforth (David Copperfield) is one of David Copperfield’s fellow students at Salem House school. Steerforth is egotistical, conniving, and uses his mother’s immense wealth to get his way in many things, such as having a teacher and friend of David fired. David reconnects with Steerforth several years after their schooling together and introduces Steerforth to the Peggotty family. Subsequently, Steerforth seduces Emily and elopes with her the night before Emily’s planned marriage to Ham. Emily and Steerforth spend several years living in Europe before Steerforth abandons Emily, who is very nearly forced into a life of prostitution before reconnecting with her family. Steerforth eventually drowns in a shipwreck in a storm off the coast of the town of Yarmouth; in a touch of dark irony, Ham dies trying to save Steerforth in the storm (though Ham does not know exactly who he is attempting to save).\n\nMr. Wilkins Micawber (David Copperfield) is a kind but financially irresponsible man known for his unfailing, poorly founded optimism that his situation will improve when “something turns up.” David briefly lives with the Micawber family before Micawber is arrested and sent to debtors’ prison. After his release, Mr. Micawber gets a job working as a clerk for Uriah Heep, an evil, scheming employee of the alcoholic lawyer Mr. Wickfield; Micawber, along with David, exposes Heep’s evil deeds. Eventually, Micawber and his family emigrate to Australia, where he finds success and financial stability. Micawber’s boundless optimism has made him one of Dickens’s most-referenced characters in other fields. Dickens based the character in large part on his own father, John Dickens, who also spent time in debtors’ prison; unlike Micawber, Dickens’s father never found financial stability.\n\nMadame Thérèse Defarge (A Tale of Two Cities) is the wife of a Parisian wine store owner named Ernest Defarge and is a bloodthirsty supporter of the French Revolution. She is often portrayed knitting; in her knitting, she records the names of people whom she wishes to see executed. Defarge bears a particular hatred for the aristocratic Evrémonde family, who in the past committed atrocities against Defarge’s siblings; this leads to her plots against Charles Darnay (a member of the family who despises their past treatment of peasants), and Darnay’s wife, Lucie Manette. Defarge and her husband are instrumental in having Darnay convicted and sentenced to the guillotine. Defarge also attempts to have Lucie arrested; however, after bursting into Lucie’s residence, she is confronted by Lucie’s governess, Miss Pross. During the ensuing struggle, Defarge is accidentally shot with her own gun and dies.\n\nWackford Squeers (Nicholas Nickleby) is the cruel headmaster of Dotheboys Hall, a Yorkshire boarding school where Nicholas is employed as a teacher. Squeers, who has only one eye, starves and otherwise severely mistreats the students at Dotheboys, as most are sent to the school merely to get them out of their parents’ houses. Squeers is especially cruel to a boy named Smike; eventually, Nicholas snaps and violently beats Squeers to protect Smike before leaving the school with the boy in tow. Squeers, along with Nicholas’s villainous uncle Ralph Nickleby, continue to scheme to remove Smike into their own control. Squeers is eventually arrested for his crimes and transported to Australia. Although Dickens claimed Squeers was not based on any one person, many scholars believe the character was based on William Shaw, the real-life one-eyed cruel headmaster of Bowes Academy, who also has the same initials as Squeers.\n\nJacob Marley (A Christmas Carol) is the former business partner of Ebenezer Scrooge. Marley died seven years before the story takes place. Scrooge is an elderly miser who hates Christmas, ignores his family, and severely mistreats his employees. Marley’s face first appears to Scrooge in place of Scrooge’s doorknocker; Scrooge dismisses this as “humbug.” Marley’s ghost later fully appears to Scrooge wrapped in a chain weighed down with padlocks and heavy cashboxes. Marley, who states “Mankind was my business,” rebuffs Scrooge’s attempts to pass him off as a hallucination brought on by indigestion and informs Scrooge that the chain he wears was “forged in life” from his greed. Moreover, he says Scrooge’s own chain was just as long seven years ago and has grown longer since. Marley disappears, warning Scrooge that three spirits will come to visit, and that Scrooge yet has a chance of escaping the kind of afterlife torment Marley is experiencing.\n\nDaniel Quilp (The Old Curiosity Shop) is a fiendish dwarf who seeks to marry the teenage protagonist, “Little Nell” Trent and gain control of the title business. He accomplishes the latter goal for a time by lending money to Nell’s grandfather, then seizing the shop when the grandfather gambles the money away. Quilp is a client of the unscrupulous attorney Sampson Brass, who hires Quilp’s mentee, Dick Swiveller. When Nell and her grandfather leave London, they are pursued by both Quilp and Nell’s only friend, Kit Nubbles; Quilp attempts to frame Kit as a thief but is foiled by Dick and the Marchioness. As his crimes are found out, Quilp dies while running from the police through the London fog, falling off his own wharf into the Thames and drowning.\n\nThomas Gradgrind (Hard Times) is the extremely utilitarian superintendent of a school in the fictional northern English city of Coketown, which employs the schoolmaster Mr. M’Choakumchild and is attended by the independent-minded circus girl Cecilia “Sissy” Jupe. Gradgrind’s obsession with facts is displayed in the novel’s first lines, which he speaks: “Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life.” Gradgrind’s daughter Louisa enters a loveless marriage with Gradgrind’s business associate Josiah Bounderby, whose bank is robbed by Gradgrind’s son Tom. Like many Dickens characters, Gradgrind’s name has gained a generic use, referring to a cold, emotionless person."

    "title": "Works Of Horror Fiction",
    "content": "“The Fall of the House of Usher” by Edgar Allan Poe (1839) Poe wrote “The Fall of the House of Usher” in the style of Gothic literature, which centers on atmospheres of dread and haunting; “Usher” contains extreme emphases on the supernatural and macabre. In the story, the unnamed narrator visits Roderick Usher—a sick old friend—at his crumbling lakeside mansion, which Roderick thinks may be alive. Roderick’s sister Madeline is also ill and eventually succumbs and is interred in the Ushers’ crypt. In the coming days, Roderick and the narrator hear strange noises. During a storm, Roderick screams that the lake outside is glowing and the two hear more noises before being attacked by Madeline, who had been mistakenly buried alive (a frequent trope in Poe’s stories). Roderick dies of fright and Madeline drops dead; the narrator flees the house as it cracks in two and sinks into the waters.\n\n“The Yellow Wallpaper” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1892) Inspired by Gilman’s own bouts of depression, “The Yellow Wallpaper” chronicles a young wife undergoing a controversial, real-life therapy called a “rest cure” for her mental illness. This requires her to be kept in her bed in a room in an isolated house where all mental stimuli are forbidden. She becomes fixated on the intricate yellow wallpaper in her room; as her husband continues confining her, she begins to believe there is a shadowy woman inside the wallpaper who must be freed, and she starts compulsively peeling it. The story’s tone begins calm, but by the end—when the woman’s husband finally unlocks the door and faints upon seeing what the narrator has become—the narration vividly devolves into near-incoherent ravings. “The Yellow Wallpaper” has been extensively analyzed by feminist critics for its themes of being literally “trapped” by one’s husband.\n\nDracula by Bram Stoker (1897) Vampire fiction had existed in the century prior to Dracula (most notably John William Polidori’s The Vampyre and Sheridan Le Fanu’s Carmilla), but Stoker’s Dracula was such a success that it codified almost all recognizable modern vampire tropes—including sleeping in a coffin of dirt, a lack of reflection, shapeshifting abilities, and needing an invitation to cross a threshold—all of which Stoker invented. Stoker took the name Dracula from Dracul, the family name of Vlad the Impaler, a historical Romanian ruler noted for his extreme cruelty toward his enemies. The story is epistolary (told via characters’ journals and letters) and begins with Jonathan Harker being sent to Transylvania to help a count named Dracula buy homes in England. Dracula sails to England and soon preys upon Lucy Westenra, who in turn preys on innocents and children. Harker, his Texan friend Quincey Morris, and the academic Abraham Van Helsing eventually deduce Dracula’s true nature and kill him by slashing his throat and driving Morris’s bowie knife through his heart.\n\nThe Turn of the Screw by Henry James (1898) Commissioned explicitly as a ghost story for Collier’s Weekly, the novella The Turn of the Screw follows a governess hired to raise Miles and Flora, two children who live in a mansion in rural England. The governess learns that her predecessor Miss Jessel died, as did another servant, Peter Quint, whom Jessel loved. Two unfamiliar figures keep appearing around the estate; the governess worries that they are talking to Miles and Flora and may actually be Jessel and Quint’s ghosts. Miles tells the governess that he cannot recall why he was expelled from school, hinting that he may already have come under Quint’s control. In a climactic scene, the governess sees Quint’s ghost at a window and shields Miles from the phantom, but when it vanishes, Miles has died. The Turn of the Screw is noted for its unreliable narrator, with many critics positing that the ghosts are a product of the governess’ mind. The novel Jane Eyre was a key inspiration for James’s work.\n\n“The Monkey’s Paw” by W. W. Jacobs (1902) The White family are on vacation when Morris, a friend and soldier, shows them a mummified monkey paw that he says grants wishes at a great price. The Whites take the paw and wish for money, which manifests as them being compensated when their son dies in a work accident. Their hasty second wish, to restore the son to life, is quickly followed by sudden banging at the front door. Mrs. White, fearing that their son is now the living dead, makes a third wish; when Mr. White opens the door, no one is there. Many folktales have explored un-ideal wishes (Faust and “Aladdin,” in particular), but “The Monkey’s Paw” originated the trope of an ironic twist resulting from a wish being granted in the exact literal sense.\n\n“The Call of Cthulhu” by H. P. Lovecraft (1928) This core story in Lovecraft’s “mythos” about the ancient god-level alien Cthulhu is told in three parts. In the first, a young artist dreams of a weird city and sculpts an image of an octopus-dragon-man; in the second, a New Orleans police raid on a cult devoted to the “Great Old Ones” yields a similar statuette; in the third account, a ship stumbles upon an uncharted island city with non-Euclidean geometry where sailors mistakenly awaken and release Cthulhu, a titanic monster (this third, climactic section is a rework of Lovecraft’s early story “Dagon”). As in most of Lovecraft’s fiction, “The Call of Cthulhu” features educated men whose scientific expertise proves ineffective and useless against the universe’s hidden truths—a central element of Lovecraft’s genre of “cosmic horror.”\n\nThe Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson (1959) Dr. John Montague recruits three companions for a planned paranormal study at Hill House, a supposedly haunted mansion. The team of four experiences many supernatural events, but the protagonist, Eleanor Vance, is the target of the most by far—including ghostly chalk writing that identifies Eleanor by name. Other events, such as touches in the dark, apparitions, and entities trying to open locked doors, are never depicted with total clarity, and Jackson presents many explanations for them, including real ghosts, Eleanor being insane, or even the notion that Eleanor has unknown telekinesis; this ambiguity is universally praised, and has led the novel to be esteemed by horror authors and literary critics alike since its release. By the end of the novel, Eleanor has become certain she “belongs” at Hill House, and when the team forces her to leave, she deliberately drives her car into a tree.\n\nSomething Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury (1962) Jim and Will are two teenagers whose town is visited by a carnival run by Mr. Dark, who has an uncanny ability to fulfill people’s desires. The boys learn that the carnival’s carousel can age or de-age whoever rides it, and Mr. Dark and his workers—including the “Dust Witch”—are evil entities who feed on people’s lifeforce. Jim, Will, and Will’s father Charles discover that laughter and smiles weaken the carnival; they use a bullet engraved with a smile to kill the Dust Witch and use the carousel to make Mr. Dark age into a tiny boy who is killed by joyful laughing. The novel is often compared to Bradbury’s non-horror novel Dandelion Wine for its nostalgic depiction of small-town life. Bradbury took the novel’s title from a line spoken by one of the three witches in Shakespeare’s Macbeth.\n\nInterview with the Vampire by Anne Rice (1976) Anne Rice’s debut novel spans 200 years in the life of Louis de Pointe du Lac, an American planter who is turned into a vampire by Lestat de Lioncourt (the main character in Rice’s The Vampire Chronicles series). Lestat and Louis have a contentious friendship that is further complicated when Lestat turns the little girl Claudia into a vampire, which keeps her perpetually young as time passes. Their resentment prompts them to try to burn Lestat alive and flee to Europe, where Claudia is killed by a coven of theatre-loving vampires after Lestat (who survived) pursues them to Paris. Louis escapes back to the U.S., where Lestat also now resides in a derelict house in New Orleans. The novel helped solidify several post-Dracula vampire tropes, such as that sunlight incinerates vampires (an element first depicted in the silent film Nosferatu) and that they are immortal and un-aging. The book owed much of its initial and continuing success to gay fans; while Interview with the Vampire does not feature overt gay romance, many LGBT critics identify queer themes of isolation and subtextual homoeroticism in Lestat and Louis’s relationship.\n\nIt by Stephen King (1986) The title entity of It is an interdimensional creature that terrorizes the small town of Derry, Maine (a recurring locale in King’s novels, along with Maine in general). “It” is a shapeshifter who manifests in many terrifying forms, but most often as the sinister Pennywise the Dancing Clown. The novel is told in two parallel timelines: one in which a group of outcast classmates, “the Losers Club,” are menaced by “It” (as well as by the bigoted bully Henry Bowers); and another timeline 27 years later when “It” returns and the Losers Club reunites to kill “It” in a reality-bending battle of will. The way “It” resurfaces periodically has prompted critics to view “It” as a manifestation of America’s cultural evils, which is supported by several incidents in It of explicitly racial, religious, and homophobic violence. The novel’s two major screen adaptations—a 1990 miniseries starring Tim Curry and a 2010s film duology starring Bill Skarsgård—have entrenched Pennywise the Clown as one the most iconic monsters in all of horror media."

    "title": "Works By Fyodor Dostoevsky",
    "content": "Crime and Punishment (1866): Rodion Raskolnikov, a former law student living in St. Petersburg, meets a drunkard named Semyon Marmeladov, whose daughter Sonya prostituted herself to raise money for their family. Seeing similarities to his own sister Dunya, who works as a governess for the perverse Svidrigailov and is engaged to the opportunistic Luzhin, Raskolnikov is moved to murder a pawnbroker named Alyona and her sister Lizaveta in an intended display of radicalism, as he believes that extraordinary people, such as Napoleon, should be allowed to commit crimes for the greater good. He then falls into a state of delirium, dreaming of a peasant named Mikolka beating a horse to death, and is cared for by his former classmate Razumikhin. After witnessing Marmeladov’s death in a carriage accident, and while being hounded by the detective Porfiry Petrovich, Raskolnikov meets Sonya, whose reading of the story of Lazarus rising from the dead eventually moves him to confess. The novel ends with Raskolnikov having been exiled to a Siberian penal colony, where he begins his road to redemption with the help of Sonya.\n\nNotes from Underground (1864): An unnamed narrator chronicles his thoughts while living as a recluse with an ailing liver in St. Petersburg, introducing himself by stating “I am a sick man…I am a spiteful man.” In the novella’s first section, the narrator criticizes the utopian ideals exemplified by the Crystal Palace in Nikolai Chernyshevsky’s novel What Is to Be Done?. In the novella’s second section, “Apropos of the Wet Snow,” the narrator recounts how he sought to exact revenge on an officer who had previously belittled him by buying an expensive coat and bumping into him on the street. He also describes how he met with his friend Simonov, attended a farewell party for his old classmate Zverkov, and revoked the salary of his servant Apollon. He laments how he had rejected the kindness of a prostitute named Liza, before the novella abruptly ends with an editorial note stating “It seems to us that we may stop here.”\n\nThe Brothers Karamazov (1879): Dmitri, Ivan, and Alyosha Karamazov return to their father Fyodor to settle matters of their inheritance. Alyosha separately observes a group of schoolboys throwing rocks at the sickly Ilyusha; when Alyosha attempts to help, Ilyusha bites Alyosha’s finger. Alyosha then attempts to donate money to Ilyusha’s father Snegiryov, who throws the money on the ground. Later, Ivan recounts to Alyosha the parable of the “Grand Inquisitor,” in which the title figure is kissed on the lips by Jesus Christ. After Alyosha’s faith is shaken by the rotting corpse of Elder Zosima, a woman named Grushenka tells him a story in which an angel rescues a drowning man from a lake using an onion. Ilyusha is chastised after feeding a dog a piece of bread with a pin inside of it at the behest of Smerdyakov, a servant who is speculated to be the illegitimate child of Fyodor and “Reeking Lizaveta.” Dmitri is soon thereafter accused of murdering his father, while Ivan attempts to prove that Smerdyakov was the real perpetrator.\n\nThe Idiot (1868): While returning from a Swiss sanatorium where he was treated for epilepsy, Prince Myshkin—a “positively good and beautiful man” meant to exemplify Christian values—meets the merchant Rogozhin, who plans to use his inheritance to pursue the object of his affection, Nastasya Filippovna. Through his relative Lizaveta Prokofyevna, Myshkin meets and soon falls in love with her daughter Aglaya; he learns that they aim to wed Nastasya to Ganya, an assistant to Lizaveta’s husband General Epanchin. Rogozhin bids for Nastasya’s hand in marriage by offering 100,000 rubles, which she tosses in the fire. At a dinner party, the young Ippolit pontificates on Hans Holbein’s painting of The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb before unsuccessfully attempting to commit suicide with an unloaded gun. Aglaya’s family begins to disapprove of Myshkin when his wild gesticulations lead to him accidentally breaking their Chinese vase. Nastasya demands to be wed to Myshkin, but is then murdered by Rogozhin, causing Myshkin to go mad and be recommitted to the Swiss sanatorium.\n\nDemons (1871): The narrator, Anton Lavrentyevich, details how Stepan Trofimovich was employed by Varvara Petrovna as a tutor for her son Nikolai Stavrogin, who is allegedly involved with three women—Liza Tushina, Dasha Pavlovna, and the crippled Marya Timofeevna, who lives with her brother Captain Lebyadkin. Stepan’s son Pyotr Stepanovich also attempts to convince Nikolai to join his movement of radical nihilists. After Dasha’s brother Ivan Shatov reveals that Nikolai is married to Marya, Pyotr sends the convict Fedka to kill the Lebyadkins and flirts with the governess Julia Mikhaylovna, whose husband Andrey Antonovich loses his mind when their literary gala is hijacked by radicals and a fire breaks out at the ensuing ball. After the Lebyadkins’ corpses are found in their home, Liza and her cousin Mavriky Nikolaevich head over to investigate but are murdered. Pyotr incites the radicals to kill Shatov and convinces Nikolai’s friend Kirillov to commit suicide and take the blame for the murders. The novel also features one censored chapter, “At Tikhon’s,” that was restored and translated by Virginia Woolf.\n\nPoor Folk (1845): Second cousins Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova write letters to each other while living in different destitute buildings on the same street. Devushkin lives in a kitchen, from which he often overhears the hungry groans of his neighbors, the Gorshkovs. It is also revealed that Dobroselova, while living with landlady Anna Fyodorovna, once met and fell in love with a student named Pokrovsky, saving up money to purchase for him a full collection of Pushkin’s works; Pokrovsky had died of illness soon after, with Dobroselova by his side. As the two cousins continue to correspond, Dobroselova accidentally offends Devushkin by sending him a copy of Gogol’s “The Overcoat,” finding the protagonist to be similar to himself. Dobroselova is eventually proposed to by a rich widower named Mr. Bykov, abandoning Devushkin in his life of squalor by sending him a final letter saying, “All is over.” Devushkin responds that he loves her and that he will die soon after she leaves.\n\n“White Nights” (1848): While walking through St. Petersburg one night, an unnamed narrator saves a girl named Nastenka from being harassed by a man. After bonding over their shared feelings of isolation, the narrator tells Nastenka that he thinks of himself as a “dreamer.” Nastenka relates to him her “history,” detailing how she lives with her blind grandmother, and the year prior fell in love with a lodger who invited them to a performance of The Barber of Seville; before leaving town, the lodger told her that he would return to marry her, but has not reached out since. The narrator helps Nastenka write a letter to the lodger, but he falls in love with her; when he finally professes his love, she reciprocates. As they walk home together, however, they run into the lodger, and Nastenka embraces her found lover, leaving the narrator behind. The story ends with the narrator reading an apologetic letter from Nastenka and wondering if such a “moment of bliss” is “sufficient for the whole of a man’s life.”\n\nThe Gambler (1866): A tutor named Alexei Ivanovich works for a family governed by the General, who sends daily telegrams to Moscow in hopes that his aunt has died so that he can collect her inheritance. At the request of the General’s stepdaughter Polina, Alexei plays roulette at the town casino and gives her his winnings. Polina then challenges Alexei to prove his love to her by insulting the Baron and Baroness Wurmerhelm. The General’s aunt appears and reveals that she knows of the General’s greedy intentions before asking Alexei to go to the casino with her. Polina also reveals that she is the mistress of the Marquis des Grieux, to whom her father is indebted, and asks Alexei to win her more money at the casino before running off with the Englishman Mr. Astley. He is further manipulated into squandering his fortune by Mademoiselle Blanche de Cominges; she thereafter leaves him for the General. Perhaps more notable than the novel’s plot are the circumstances of its creation: Dostoevsky wrote it in less than a month to satisfy an onerous contract he took on to pay off his own roulette-induced gambling debts, and did so with the help of stenographer Anna Snitkina, whom he later married.\n\nThe Double (1846): Subtitled “A Petersburg Poem,” “The Double” follows a bureaucrat in St. Petersburg named Yakov Golyadkin, who is told by his physician Doctor Rutenspitz that he should treat his antisocial behavior by attending a party. He attempts to sneak into the birthday party of his manager’s daughter Klara Olsufyevna through a back stairwell, but is caught and kicked out; as he walks home through a snowstorm, he encounters a man who looks exactly like himself. Although initially friendly with each other, Golyadkin soon learns that his “double” is more charismatic and successful than him, watching helplessly as he charms his associates and gradually takes over his life; he even argues with his servant Petrushka over which of the two should actually be called “master.” Eventually, Golyadkin goes insane and is dragged off to an asylum by Doctor Rutenspritz.\n\n“An Honest Thief” (1848): An unnamed narrator takes in a lodger named Astafy Ivanovich, who, after the narrator’s coat is stolen by an unknown thief, relates to him a story about how he had once been the victim of a thief named Emelyan Ilyitch. Although Astafy wanted to help Emelyan in good faith at first, it became clear that Emelyan’s alcoholism was at the root of his financial troubles. Tensions between the two came to a head when a pair of expensive riding breeches that Astafy had tailored and planned on selling suddenly went missing; Astafy suspected Emelyan of the theft, but Emelyan denied the allegations. After an argument ensued over the missing breeches, Emelyan stormed out and disappeared for several days, only to return nearly dead from the cold. As he lay dying in Astafy’s care, Emelyan confessed with his last words that he was indeed the thief."

    "title": "Piano Sonatas",
    "content": "Ludwig van Beethoven, Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor (Op. 27 No. 2), “Moonlight”: Marked “quasi una fantasia,” or “almost like a fantasy,” and dedicated to his pupil Giulietta Guicciardi, Ludwig van Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 14 was nicknamed “Moonlight” decades after its composition by critic Ludwig Rellstab due to its perceived evocation of Lake Lucerne at nighttime. The first movement, marked Adagio sostenuto, opens with the right hand playing slow triplets outlining a second-inversion C-sharp minor triad; this first movement became so popular that Beethoven reportedly complained to his student Carl Czerny, “Surely I’ve written better things.” The second movement, a D-flat major Allegretto minuet in 3/4 time, was dubbed a “flower between two chasms” by Franz Liszt. The Presto agitato third movement was highly regarded by many; according to Ernst Oster, Frederic Chopin was inspired by the stormy C-sharp minor arpeggios that open the movement to write his compositionally similar Fantaisie-Impromptu.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven, Piano Sonata No. 29 in B-flat Major (Op. 106), “Hammerklavier”: Dedicated to Archduke Rudolph, Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 29—published under the title “Grosse Sonate für das Hammer-Klavier,” leading to its nickname—was allegedly described by Beethoven himself as “a hard nut to crack.” It was long thought unplayable until 1836, when Franz Liszt performed it to an enthusiastic review by Hector Berlioz. The sonata’s Allegro first movement, which opens with a series of fortissimo B-flat major chords, bears an impossibly fast tempo marking of 138 BPM on the half note. The second-movement scherzo, marked Assai vivace, includes a trio that interpolates the “Eroica” Symphony’s main theme. The Adagio sostenuto third movement in F-sharp minor has been referred to as a “mausoleum of collective sorrow” due to its slow and solemn pace. The piece’s fourth movement then opens by modulating from the third movement’s key, with quasi-improvisatorial ascending octaves of unharmonized F’s transitioning to a notoriously complex B-flat major fugue in three voices centering on a main theme that leaps by a tenth from F to A.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven, Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor (Op. 13), “Pathétique”: Dedicated to Prince Karl von Lichnowsky, Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor opens with a first movement that alternates between a slow Grave theme and a livelier Allegro con brio section. The A-flat major second movement, marked Adagio cantabile, begins with a theme consisting of the notes C, B-flat, E-flat, D-flat, C played while the right hand crosses over into the bass clef to play a series of slow, undulating sixteenth notes. The third movement, a Rondo allegro, draws material from the preceding two. The second movement is arguably the sonata’s most influential; Edward Elgar claimed he “hinted” at it in the “Nimrod” movement of his Enigma Variations.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven, Piano Sonata No. 23 in F minor (Op. 57), “Appassionata”: Dedicated to Count Franz Brunswick, Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 23 in F minor opens its Allegro assai first movement with both hands playing descending and ascending dotted F-minor arpeggios in 12/8 time before repeating the theme a semitone higher. The Andante con moto second movement is a set of variations in D-flat major that ends with a pianissimo deceptive cadence before a sudden fortissimo diminished seventh chord that proceeds attacca into the sonata’s Allegro ma non troppo third movement, which itself climaxes with a coda marked Presto. Beethoven himself titled the piece “La Pasionata”; the modern nickname comes from a later arrangement of the work. Prior to composing the Hammerklavier Sonata, Beethoven considered this to be his most difficult sonata.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven, Piano Sonata No. 18 in E-flat Major (Op. 31, No. 3), “The Hunt”: As with many Beethoven works, the nickname “The Hunt” did not come from Beethoven itself; it came from a listener who felt a theme in the work’s finale resembled a horn call used during hunting. Unusually for a piano sonata, this work has four movements (rather than three) and lacks a slow movement. The Allegro first movement, which opens with a recurring dotted-eighth sixteenth figure, contains a chord that is harmonically equivalent to Richard Wagner’s Tristan chord (though Beethoven voices it differently). The sonata’s second-movement Scherzo is also atypical, as it is in double time instead of triple time and sonata form as opposed to ternary form. Camille Saint-Saëns based his two-piano Variations on Theme of Beethoven on material from the third-movement Minuet.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven, Piano Sonata No. 26 in E-flat Major (Op. 81a), “Les Adieux”: Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 26—whose title means “The Farewell” in English—is a programmatic work written after Beethoven’s patron Archduke Rudolphe fled Vienna in the wake of a Napoleonic invasion. The three chords that open the first movement’s introductory Adagio are written beneath the syllables of the word “lebewohl” (German for “farewell”). The second and third movements are titled, respectively, “Abwesenheit” (“Absence”) and “Das Wiedersehen” (“The Return”), with the latter having a German tempo instruction translating to “in the liveliest of time.” Beethoven’s work was likely inspired, at least in part, by Czech composer Jan Dussek’s piano sonata of the same name, published a decade before Beethoven wrote his.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major, K. 331: Although the first two movements of Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 11—an Andante grazioso theme and variations and a minuet, respectively—are still occasionally performed today, it is the third movement Rondo alla turca, or “Turkish March,” that has become one of the most ubiquitous pieces of classical music in popular culture. The Allegretto movement, which opens with a falling and rising sixteenth note motive in A minor, was intended by Mozart to evoke the sound of the janissary bands from the Ottoman empire, a type of early marching band that featured woodwinds, brass, drums, and cymbals; the numerous rolls in the piano’s lower registers bring to mind drumrolls, and the high, bright octaves in the right hand the blaring of trumpets.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Piano Sonata No. 16 in C Major, K. 545, “Simple”: Also known as the “Semplice” or “Facile” sonata, Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16 in C major is a common piece learned by piano students, as per Mozart’s stated intention of it being “for beginners.” The piece’s most recognizable motif comes at the beginning of its Allegro first movement, with the right hand playing the ascending notes C, E, G, then going back down to B, C, D, C. This opening theme is accompanied by a left-hand Alberti bass figure outlining a major triad. The piece’s ubiquity inspired Edvard Grieg to compose an original second piano part to be played in duet form with the original sonata.\n\nFrédéric Chopin, Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor (Op. 35): Written while living in George Sand’s manor in the village of Nohant, Chopin’s Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor opens with a Grave first movement before transitioning to a doppio movimento section that is often erroneously repeated due to an engraving error in the Leipzig edition. The sonata’s best-known portion is the third-movement “Funeral March,” an oft-excerpted and -arranged work whose opening motive of repeated B-flats has become ubiquitously associated with death (and leading to the work as a whole sometimes being nicknamed the “Funeral March”). The work’s fourth and final movement, which is marked Presto and played in 2/2 time, is composed of furious chromatic flurries of eighth notes before the final bar indicates that the pedal should be pressed to give the impression of “wind washing over graves.”\n\nFranz Liszt, Piano Sonata in B minor, S. 178: Unusually for a pianist as renowned as Liszt, the Sonata in B minor (which Liszt dedicated to Robert Schumann) was premiered not by Liszt himself, but by Hans von Bülow. This sonata is not formally split into movements, moving between its distinct sections without pause; that said, most scholars concur that the sonata has four clear sections, often likened to the movements of a symphony. The piece is an example of double-function form, with the four sections serving as both their own distinct segments and as subdivisions of a single, large unifying sonata form. Critically panned when it was premiered, Liszt’s sonata has since become a cornerstone of the piano repertoire. British composer Humphrey Searle (whose last name is the “S.” in the catalogue numbers of Liszt’s works) orchestrated the work, which became the basis for Frederick Ashton’s ballet Marguerite and Armand."

    "title": "Functional Groups",
    "content": "The simplest functional groups are alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, which are all hydrocarbons with no atoms other than carbon and hydrogen. Alkanes have only single bonds, alkenes have a carbon-carbon double bond, and alkynes have a carbon-carbon triple bond. Alkynes can be reduced through a hydrogenation reaction to create alkenes, which can be reduced again to alkanes. Many “greasy” substances like oil and wax are purely alkanes. Fats that contain no double bonds (i.e. have alkane groups) are called saturated, while fats with an alkene double bond are called unsaturated. Alkenes can be classified as cis or trans based on whether the non-hydrogen groups are on the same side of the molecule or opposite sides. Alkynes are classified as internal or terminal based on whether the triple bond is at the end or in the middle of the molecule. The simplest alkene and alkyne are ethylene (responsible for fruit ripening) and acetylene (used as a fuel in welding), respectively.\n\nAlcohols (R–O H) are defined by an –O H (oxygen and hydrogen) bonded to a carbon in an alkyl group. The –O H group by itself is called a hydroxyl group, so another equivalent way of defining an alcohol is a carbon bonded to a hydroxyl group. Common examples of alcohols include the one-carbon alcohol methanol (also called “wood alcohol,” and which can cause blindness if ingested), the two-carbon ethanol found in alcoholic drinks, and the three-carbon isopropanol found in some rubbing alcohol products. Alcohols are the simplest oxygen-containing functional group and can be oxidized to carbonyls and carboxylic acids. Having two alcohol groups on a molecule results in a diol such as ethylene glycol, the primary ingredient in most antifreeze. There are three alcohol groups in glycerol, a molecule that serves as a building block for fats.\n\nCarbonyls (R–C(O)–R′) are characterized by a carbon-oxygen double bond. The two simplest functional groups that contain a carbonyl are the aldehyde, which has a carbonyl at the end of a hydrocarbon chain, and the ketone, which has a carbonyl in the middle of a hydrocarbon chain. Some examples of aldehydes and ketones include formaldehyde (used in tissue preservation) and acetone (a solvent used in nail polish remover). Other functional groups that contain a carbonyl include the carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and ureas. Due to resonance, the carbon atom in a carbonyl has a partial positive charge, while the oxygen has a partial negative charge. This causes the carbonyl carbon to act as an electrophile in reactions, meaning it is an “electron-loving” atom that will accept electrons from a nucleophile. Carbonyls can be produced through many methods, such as oxidation reactions of alcohols or cleavage of an alkene by ozone in ozonolysis.\n\nEthers (R–O–R′) are defined by an oxygen atom bonded to two alkyl groups. They are similar to alcohols except the alcohol hydrogen is replaced by another carbon-containing fragment. Common ethers include diethyl ether (the first-developed anesthetic, where it was commonly known as just “ether”) and the laboratory solvent THF (tetrahydrofuran). Ethers can be produced through the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, in which a deprotonated alcohol nucleophilically attacks an alkyl halide. In many organic reactions that employ explosive metal-containing reagents, such as a magnesium-based Grignard reagent, an etherated solvent is used to stabilize that reactive reagent.\n\nCarboxylic acids (R–C O O H) are one of the most oxidized oxygen-containing functional groups and are characterized by a carbon atom singly bonded to one oxygen atom and doubly bonded to another oxygen atom. Carboxylic acids are frequently sour-smelling, such as the two-carbon acetic acid (found in vinegar). Other common carboxylic acids include the one-carbon formic acid (found in ants), and the three-carbon lactic acid that causes muscle soreness after strenuous exercise. As indicated by their name, carboxylic acids are relatively acidic and can thus form salts when they interact with a base, leading to a negatively charged carboxylate (such as formate, acetate, lactate, etc.). Carboxylic acids and amines are the two functional groups common to every amino acid; the carboxylic acid of one amino acid reacts with the amine of another amino acid to form a peptide bond, which contains an amide group. The end of a protein that contains a free carboxylic acid is called the C-terminus.\n\nEsters (R–C O O–R′) are similar to carboxylic acids, but they have an alkyl group in place of the acid’s hydrogen atom. Esters are characterized by their fruity smells; for example, isoamyl acetate has a strong banana-like odor and is found in many fruits. Ester linkages are found in the class of fat molecules called triglycerides, where they connect the glycerol backbone to three long fatty acid tails. Polyesters are a class of polymer that contains ester linkages between monomers; examples include PET, which is used in clothing fibers and some water bottles. The most common reaction for creating esters is the Fischer esterification, which combines a carboxylic acid and an alcohol to create an ester, releasing a molecule of water as a byproduct.\n\nAlkyl halides (R–X) are characterized by a halogen atom bonded to a hydrocarbon alkyl group (the letter X is used in organic chemistry to denote an arbitrary halogen). Many alkyl halides pose significant environmental risks, such as the CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) that were once used as refrigerants and significantly contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer. PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) such as Teflon, PFOA, and PFOS are incredibly durable and are thus deemed “forever chemicals” due to their persistence as pollutants. Despite these hazards, alkyl halides represent a useful building block in organic synthesis; the halogen atom serves as an excellent leaving group, allowing the alkyl group to be connected to a different molecule in a substitution reaction.\n\nThiols (also called mercaptans; R–SH) are defined by an –SH (sulfur and hydrogen) bonded to a carbon. They are effectively sulfur analogues of alcohols, which is sensible given that sulfur sits right below oxygen in the same column of the periodic table. Thiols are notably pungent, giving a characteristic stinky “rotten eggs” smell. A thiol group is found in the side chain of the amino acid cysteine; the two thiol groups of two cysteine residues can react to form disulfide bridges in protein folding. The ability of thiols to scavenge dangerous free radicals allows the molecule glutathione to serve as an antioxidant to protect cells from oxidative stress.\n\nAromatic compounds contain a ring system that satisfies the criteria for aromaticity. These most often feature six-membered benzene rings in phenyl groups but can include many different ring sizes and also non-carbon atoms. Common aromatic compounds include benzene, toluene, and phenol. Aromatic compounds are non-polar, meaning they feel “greasy” or oily. Ring systems are described as aromatic if and only if they are planar, essentially meaning the molecule is flat; and if they satisfy Hückel’s rule, which means the ring has 4n + 2 pi electrons for some integer n. For example, benzene has six pi electrons, which is satisfied by n = 1 and thus 4·1 + 2 = 6, so benzene is aromatic, while cyclobutadiene has four pi electrons, which does not correspond to any integer value of n, so cyclobutadiene is not aromatic. Aromatic compounds are one of the easiest to identify by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as they feature a unique downfield peak around 7 ppm due to a diamagnetic ring current.\n\nAmines (R–N R′ R″) are characterized by a nitrogen atom that is only singly bonded to carbons and hydrogens. Another way to think about them is that they are analogues of ammonia (N H3) in which at least one nitrogen is replaced by an alkyl group. Amines can also be thought of as nitrogen analogues to alcohols, and they can sometimes react similarly; for example, the reaction between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid to form an ester is analogous to the reaction between an amine and a carboxylic acid to form an amide. Also like alcohols, amines can be categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on the number of alkyl groups bonded to the nitrogen. Amines are characterized by a “fishy” smell, such as in putrescine and cadaverine found in rotting fish. Amines can react with an acid (or a carbon electrophile) to generate ammonium salts, some of which are used in disinfectants. Because amines adopt a square pyramidal geometry, they can “flip” via quantum tunneling in the nitrogen inversion, which is often analogized to an umbrella turning inside-out due to a gust of wind"

    "title": "Linguists",
    "content": "Panini (c. 5th century BCE) was a Sanskrit grammarian, who worked at Taxila, a seat of Vedic learning. He wrote the first known descriptive grammar of any language, the Ashtadhyayi. It explains differences between Vedic and later Sanskrit forms, and provides logical rules for making words from morphemes. These include the Sivasutras, which are phonological classes arrayed in a table and denoted with abbreviations. His work became the principle base for the Vedic tradition of Vyakarana, or grammatical analysis. His work had at least some influence on Leonard Bloomfield and Ferdinand de Saussure, as well as later structuralist linguists, although the extent of his contributions to modern linguistics is a subject of debate.\n\nWilliam Jones (1746–1794) was a judge and employee of the British East India company, and also a philologist, somebody who studies language through historical and primarily written sources. Most notably, he popularized the idea of a common origin for Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, and a variety of other language, which eventually led to the reconstruction of the Indo-European language family and the idea of a Proto–Indo-European language. These ideas also led him to propose a forerunner to the Aryan invasion, or Indo-Aryan migration, hypothesis regarding human migration into the Indian subcontinent. He also founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal while serving there and compiled a grammar of Persian, another Indo-European language, early in his career.\n\nFerdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) was a Swiss linguist. He created the theory of structuralism, also called structural linguistics, in which linguists analyze the structures of language and how they relate to each other. Structuralists often focus on synchronic analyses of language, which look at a language at a specific point in time, as opposed to diachronic analyses, which look at how languages change over time and were favored by German Neogrammarians. However, Saussure also contributed to the understanding of Proto–Indo-European by postulating an early version of the laryngeal theory to solve issues with Proto–Indo-European vowels. In this theory, Proto–Indo-European had two or three vowels which were modified by what he called coefficients sonantique, but which were later identified as laryngeals (/h/ sounds), based on evidence from the extinct language Hittite. Students turned his lectures into the book Course in General Linguistics, which set out his theory that words are signifiers with an arbitrary relationship to the concepts being signified, i.e. the arbitrariness of the sign.\n\nEdward Sapir (1884–1939) and Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897–1941) are two linguists best known for the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, according to which which the structure of a language shapes how people think. The strong version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is linguistic determinism, where language restricts what people can think of. Whorf supported that with evidence that views of time among the Hopi, a Native American group from Arizona, differ from Western views, but his work is mostly debunked. He also promoted the equally dubious claim that “Eskimo”, or rather Inuit languages, had many more words for snow. However, there is more support for the still-controversial weak version, in which language merely influences how people think. Sapir, a student of the anthropologist Franz Boas and later a teacher of Whorf at Yale University, also documented numerous indigenous languages of North America and wrote Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech. Whorf, by profession a fire inspector in Hartford, Connecticut, also tried to reconstruct the Uto-Aztecan language family of Mexico and the American Southwest.\n\nLeonard Bloomfield (1887–1949) developed an American school of Saussure’s structuralism, which influenced but was also later displaced by the theories of Noam Chomsky. His textbook Language was particularly influential in emphasizing studying language separately from the psychology and anthropology of its speakers. He first studied phonology (sounds) and morphology (word forms) of the Germanic languages in the Neogrammarian tradition, but later began to work more on the Tagalog language of the Philippines and on the Algonquian language family of eastern North America. His work on identifying morphemes, the smallest linguistic units of meaning, and how phonology affects them—i.e., morphophonemics—was continued by other American structuralists such as Zellig Harris and Bernard Bloch. Bloomfield also was one of the founders of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) and contributed to the first issue of its influential journal Language.\n\nNoam Chomsky (1928–) studied under the structuralist Zellig Harris but went on to develop his own theory of generative grammar. His emphasis on the biological and cognitive bases of language gave rise to his theory of child language acquisition, in which people are born with an innate linguistic capacity of Universal Grammar that is activated by hearing speech. This served as a solution to Plato’s problem, or poverty of the stimulus, of how children learn language so quickly. In his book Syntactic Structures, he used the sentence “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously” to show that it was possible for an utterance to be syntactically correct but semantically nonsensical. Later his ideas developed into government and binding and the minimalist program, which focuses on the Merge operation for building syntax trees. Chomsky also wrote extensively on politics, critiquing American imperialism and capitalism from a leftist perspective.\n\nPaul Grice (1913–1988) was a philosopher of language. He functionally invented the linguistic study of pragmatics, how people communicate in context, by putting forth a set of maxims that follow from the assumption that speakers are cooperating with each other, i.e. his cooperative principle. These are the maxim of quantity (giving the amount of information needed), the maxim of quality (being truthful), the maxim of relation (staying relevant), and the maxim of manner (speaking clearly and without ambiguity). However, speakers might violate these maxims covertly or overtly. He also popularized the idea of conversational implicatures, which are meant by the speaker despite not being expressed in the literal meaning. In philosophy, Grice critiqued J. L. Austin’s ordinary language philosophy, as set out in Sense and Sensibilia. His work was collected in Studies in the Way of Words.\n\nGeorge Lakoff (1941–) is a Berkeley linguist and cognitive scientist. He was a student of Chomsky’s theories of generative syntax, but he later became a leader of generative semantics, as chronicled in Randy Allen Harris’s book The Language Wars. Along with Paul Postal, James McCawley, and Haj Ross, Lakoff argued that meaning precedes syntactic structure in how the brain uses language. Later, Lakoff wrote The Metaphors We Live By with Mark Johnson, which cataloged specific metaphors into larger conceptual metaphors such as LOVE IS A JOURNEY. He later extended that work towards analyses of metaphors in politics, focusing on differences between liberal and conservative ways of thinking in Moral Politics and on the Persian Gulf War in Metaphor and War. In particular, he contrasted a conservative view of the nation as a strict father versus the liberal view of the nation as a nurturant parent.\n\nWilliam Labov (1927–) is a University of Pennsylvania linguist and student of Uriel Weinreich who pioneered the study of sociolinguistics, looking at how language varies across speakers. This expanded the focus of traditional dialectology to include not only regional variation but also class, race, gender, and similar traits. In one experiment, he recorded whether department store clerks in New York City pronounced the /r/s in “fourth floor” and analyzed whether it varied based on the class of the shoppers at the department stores. He also looked at how speakers’ attitudes about living on Martha’s Vineyard affected their pronunciations of diphthongs (vowels that are a combination of other vowels). Along with Sharon Ash and Charles Boberg, he published many dialect maps in the Atlas of North American English. In his paper “The Logic of Nonstandard English,” he defended African-American (Vernacular) English as a valid linguistic system based on his work documenting it in Black neighborhoods of Philadelphia.\n\nSteven Pinker (1954–) is a psycholinguist and cognitive psychologist. He analyzed Chomsky’s theories of Universal Grammar in his book The Language Instinct, in which he suggests that language comes from specific brain structures and strongly criticizes the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. His book Words and Rules proposed that the increased frequency of irregular verbs is necessary for children to learn them well. He also proposed that, in child language acquisition, children engage in semantic bootstrapping to learn syntactic structures. Outside of linguistics, he posited a general decline in human violence in The Better Angels of Our Nature and advocated evolutionary psychology in The Blank Slate."

    "title": "Concepts From Quantum Mechanics",
    "content": "Quantization is the phenomenon in which certain quantities in quantum mechanics can only take certain discrete values (unlike in classical mechanics, in which quantities can vary continuously). For example, in the Bohr model of the atom, electrons can only have discrete values of energy, and are said to occupy energy levels. The quantization of energy was discovered by Max Planck, who, in his studies on blackbodies, proposed that electromagnetic energy could only be emitted in discrete, quantized packets. Today, we call these packets photons, which are individual particles of light. Mathematically, Planck discovered that the energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency, with the constant of proportionality being Planck’s constant. Planck’s constant appears in many equations in quantum mechanics; it is represented by h, and it also has a form called the reduced Planck’s constant, which equals Planck’s constant over 2 π and is represented by ħ, pronounced “h-bar.”\n\nSuperposition is the principle by which a quantum system can exist in a state that is a simultaneous combination of two or more discrete states. For example, consider a system in which a single particle can be in either position A or position B. In quantum mechanics, there is also a superposition state that combines the state where the particle is in position A and the state where the particle is in position B. According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the particle in the superposition state is in neither position A nor B. However, when the system is observed (such as by an experimenter attempting to take a measurement of the particle’s position), the superposition state collapses, and the experimenter will observe the particle to be in either position A or position B. The exact location of the particle does not exist until an external observer intervenes. The apparent absurdity of this real quantum phenomenon is demonstrated in the Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment, in which a cat in a box exists in a quantum superposition of being alive and dead, until the experimenter opens the box to discover either a living or a dead cat.\n\nWave-particle duality is the idea that quantum systems can display both wave-like and particle-like properties. For example, while light was classically thought to be a wave—as demonstrated by the diffraction pattern produced in Thomas Young’s double-slit experiment—some phenomena, such as the Planck model of blackbodies mentioned above, can only be explained by light existing as discrete photons. In the photoelectric effect, light shined onto a metal causes the metal to emit electrons. However, the electrons are only emitted when the energy of the light is above a minimum threshold. The threshold is dependent on the type of metal being studied and is called the work function. The existence of this minimum threshold could only be explained by viewing light as photons, an explanation that helped Albert Einstein win the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921. While those studies showed that waves could act like particles, the duality was shown to be two-sided when electrons—classically thought to be particles—were shown to also act like waves. In the Davisson–Germer experiment, electrons were diffracted off a nickel crystal. The diffraction pattern was similar to one predicted by Bragg’s law, which governs the wave-like diffraction of X-rays. The electrons were acting like waves with a wavelength (called the de Broglie wavelength) equal to Planck’s constant divided by momentum. Later, electrons were shown to also produce the same diffraction pattern as light waves in a double-slit experiment setup.\n\nHeisenberg’s uncertainty principle roughly states that the value of certain pairs of properties cannot be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. For example, if an experimenter attempts to very precisely measure the momentum of a particle, they will not be able to precisely measure its position, while if they instead attempt to precisely measure its momentum, they will not be able to precisely measure its position. It is most commonly applied to position and momentum, but is true for any canonically conjugate pair of variables, such as energy and time. More precisely, the uncertainty principle states that the product of the standard deviation of position and momentum must be greater than Planck’s constant divided by 4 π. The uncertainty principle can be rigorously proved using the Fourier transform. Quantum states that have the lowest possible uncertainty are called coherent states. Heisenberg’s microscope is a thought experiment that provides an argument for the uncertainty principle using classical optics.\n\nSpin is a quantity possessed by elementary particles in quantum mechanics. It is a form of intrinsic angular momentum. Despite the name, spin does not refer to a particle literally spinning; it is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon with no classical analogue. Spin can take on integer or half-integer values, and it can be positive or negative, corresponding to whether the angular momentum vector points “up” or “down”; for example, the electron has a spin of ±½, while photons have a spin of ±1. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions, and particles with integer spin are called bosons. The quantization of spin angular momentum was demonstrated in the Stern–Gerlach experiment, in which particles traveling through a magnetic field were alternately deflected up or down depending on the direction of their spin.\n\nQuantum tunneling is a phenomenon in which a quantum particle passes through a potential energy barrier that it could not pass through classically. For example, in classical mechanics, if a particle does not have enough energy to get over a hill, it must always roll back down the hill. In quantum mechanics, however, there is a small probability it will get over the hill. Quantum tunneling is a consequence of the wave-like behavior of particles, and it corresponds to an exponentially decaying wavefunction. George Gamow used tunneling to mathematically explain how an alpha particle escapes from a nucleus despite not having enough energy to do so classically. It also forms the basis for how scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) work. In STMs, a small voltage is applied, which allows electrons to tunnel through a vacuum. By measuring the resultant current, it is possible to map an atomic surface. In stars, tunneling is used to help overcome the Coulomb barrier to allow nuclear fusion to occur. Tunneling also allows Esaki diodes to display negative resistances.\n\nEntanglement occurs when the state of each particle in a group cannot be described independently of the other particles. This can occur even when the particles are separated by large distances, an apparent violation of the principle of locality. Entanglement was described by Einstein as “spooky action at a distance” and was first introduced in the paper “Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?”, by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR). They introduced the EPR paradox, in which two entangled particles A and B are physically separated by an extremely large distance, say many light-years apart. The spin of A is then measured, so the spin of B is now instantaneously determined, even though no information could possibly have traveled between A and B (special relativity limits the speed of causality to be no greater than the speed of light). Bell’s theorem states that no theory with hidden variables is able to explain entanglement. Entangled particles also violate Bell’s inequalities. The quantum eraser experiment can be explained using entanglement. In this experiment, a variant of the classic double-slit experiment, two entangled photons are created, and measuring anything about the first photon affects the second photon, which can destroy an interference pattern created by the second photon.\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state at the same time. It is a result of the fact that fermions’ half-integer spin means they have antisymmetric wavefunctions, and thus the wavefunction of two identical fermions in the same quantum state cancels out to zero. A consequence of the exclusion principle is that the two electrons in the same atomic orbital must have opposite values for spin. The exclusion principle was first formulated by Wolfgang Pauli for electrons, before the proof of the spin-statistics theorem allowed it to be extended to all fermions. Electron degeneracy pressure in white dwarfs is a consequence of the exclusion principle, since it means electrons packed into a very small volume must occupy states with higher kinetic energy, resulting in a large pressure.\n\nBose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter formed when a low-density gas of bosons is cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero. A BEC forms when a very high proportion of the particles simultaneously occupy the lowest-energy quantum state (or ground state). While the Pauli exclusion principle prevents fermions from occupying the same quantum state, there is no such restriction for bosons. Bose–Einstein condensates are sometimes called the “fifth state of matter.” The first Bose–Einstein condensate was observed when Carl Wiemann and Eric Cornell used lasers to cool rubidium-87 atoms. This won them and Wolfgang Ketterle the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nThe wavefunction is a mathematical description of a quantum state in an isolated system, and a way of formalizing many of the ideas discussed above. It is usually represented using a uppercase or lowercase Greek letter psi (Ψ or ψ respectively). In the Copenhagen interpretation, the wavefunction is viewed as a “probability amplitude,” meaning the square of the wavefunction gives the probability density of measuring a particle in a particular place. For example, consider a one-dimensional particle in a box (also called the infinite square well). The wavefunction for the particle in a box is represented by a sine wave, with the period of the sine wave depending on the energy level of the particle. The crests and troughs of the wave represent positions where the particle has a high probability of being located (were an observer to measure the system and collapse the wavefunction), while at the nodes of the wave, the particle has a zero probability of being at that position. To ensure the total probability measure is one, the spatial integral of the wavefunction times its complex complement must equal one. This condition is called normalization. An atomic orbital can be represented as a wavefunction, representing the possible positions an electron can be in.\n\nOperators are mathematical functions that act on wavefunctions to yield values of physical quantities called observables. For example, if you know a particle’s wavefunction and want to calculate its momentum, you apply the momentum operator to the wavefunction, and the result equals the particle’s momentum (the observable of interest) multiplied by its wavefunction. The operator corresponding to total energy in quantum mechanics has a special name, the Hamiltonian. Using the techniques of linear algebra, operators in quantum mechanics can be represented by matrices, while wavefunctions can be represented by column vectors. The observables are thus the eigenvalues of the operator (while the wavefunction is the eigenvector).\n\nThe commutator is a function that measures the degree to which the two operators obey the commutative property. It is represented by a pair of square brackets; the commutator of operators A and B is written [A, B] and is equal to A B − B A. If the commutator of two operators is zero, the operators are said to commute, and their corresponding observables can be simultaneously measured. The commutator between the position and momentum operators is not zero, instead equaling i ħ, and thus position and momentum cannot be simultaneously measured (i.e., the uncertainty principle). The ability of an operator to commute with the Hamiltonian has a special property; if an operator commutes with the Hamiltonian, its corresponding observable is a conserved quantity. The commutator is analogous to the Poisson bracket from classical mechanics.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation governing how the wavefunction changes in time and space. It has both time-dependent and time-independent forms. The time-independent form states that the Hamiltonian operator applied to the wavefunction equals energy times the wavefunction, while the time-dependent form states that the Hamiltonian applied to the wavefunction equals i ħ times the time derivative of the wavefunction. The Schrödinger equation can be seen as a quantum generalization of Newton’s second law (using Ehrenfest’s theorem). The Schrödinger equation has exact analytical solutions only for relatively simple systems, such as the particle in a box, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the hydrogen atom. For more complicated systems, techniques like perturbation theory, the variational principle, and the WKB approximation are used to obtain approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation."

    "content": "Lascaux (France) In 1940 French teenager Marcel Ravidat’s dog found a hole under a recently fallen tree that led to a totally unknown cave system rich with prehistoric cave paintings. He initially thought it was a rumored secret tunnel to nearby Lascaux Manor. Lascaux’s trove of cave art comprises some 600 paintings; some of the most famous are in the Hall of the Bulls, where many panels depict extinct bovines called aurochs—some stretching over 16 feet in length. A passage off the Hall of the Bulls leads to chambers called the Apse, Nave, and Shaft; the Nave’s panels include a scene of deer swimming, while the Shaft hosts a much-studied image of a bison next to a fallen, naked, bird-headed man. Since 1963, touring Lascaux has been tightly restricted to limit damage from mold and humidity caused by visitors’s breath.\n\nMohenjo-daro (Pakistan) Located in central Pakistan, Mohenjo-daro was a sprawling city of the Indus Valley Civilization (once called the Harappan Civilization, after another of its type-sites, Harappa). It flourished in the late 3rd millennium BC; many scholars hold that regular “mud floods” and depletion of nearby natural resources caused its gradual abandonment. Unlike most early cities, Mohenjo-daro bears evidence of urban design and planning: it was built on a deliberate grid containing multiple “islands” of uniform rectangular dimensions. A central “Citadel” looms higher than the rest of the city and contained a huge granary and a sunken brick Great Bath. Two artifacts from Mohenjo-daro have become iconic: the “Dancing Girl,” a four-inch bronze statuette of a girl posed with one hand on her hip; and the speculatively titled “Priest-King,” a soapstone sculpture of an imperious, bearded man wearing a floral print robe.\n\nUr (Iraq) The ancient ruins near the modern-day Iraqi town of Tell el-Muqayya were known for centuries, but it was only in the mid-19th century that Henry Rawlinson identified them as Ur, a Sumerian city-state that thrived in the 3rd millennium BC. The Great Ziggurat of Ur, dedicated to Ur’s patron deity Nanna, was identified relatively early; the other major artifacts at Ur were uncovered by British Museum projects led by Sir Leonard Woolley, particularly at Ur’s Royal Cemetery. Notable artifacts include the Standard of Ur, a wooden box inlaid with three tiers of mosaics showing processions of soldiers and animals; the Lyres of Ur, a pair of harp-like instruments stylized with bulls’ heads; and a lapis lazuli cylinder seal identifying the lavish tomb of “Queen” Puabi.\n\nKnossos (Greece) Knossos contains ruins of the Minoans, a Bronze Age society on the Greek island of Crete. Excavations began in 1877, but it was the English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans’s projects starting in 1900 that unearthed its most significant finds, including much of the Palace of Minos. The palace’s Throne Room has walls painted in tiers of red and white, with images of animals and foliage; elsewhere, an iconic “bull-leaping fresco” shows the Minoans’ daredevil tradition of jumping over bulls. Two writing systems identified at Knossos were grouped as Linear A and Linear B; Linear A remains undeciphered to this day. Evans also led reconstructions at Knossos now regarded as dubious in their accuracy, particularly his assembling of so-called “snake goddess” figurines of women holding wriggling snakes.\n\nLuxor and the Valley of the Kings (Egypt) The modern-day city of Luxor sits over what was once the Egyptian capital Thebes, which itself lay across the Nile from its necropolis, the Valley of the Kings. The sheer density of ancient archaeological sites near Luxor has led some to liken it to one huge open-air museum. Luxor is home to the Luxor Temple, whose entry is flanked with twin statues of Ramses II. The Avenue of the Sphinxes links Luxor Temple to Karnak, another huge temple noted for its towering Great Hypostyle Hall, whose columns are inscribed top-to-bottom with hieroglyphs. The nearby Valley of the Kings is home to many royal burial sites, all designated “KV.” Such sites include KV62, where Howard Carter located the tomb of King Tutankhamun, and KV20, the lavish long-ramped mortuary temple of Hatshepsut, a powerful female pharaoh.\n\nMausoleum of Qin Shi Huang (China) Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China, was buried in the 3rd century BC in a mausoleum near the city of Xi’an. His tomb is under an extremely broad truncated earthen pyramid, “protected” by the Terracotta Army, a collection of over 8,000 life-size clay statues of soldiers, cavalry, archers, and officers, all facing east (the direction of the emperor’s rivals). Weapons buried near the army were made using an unusual thirteen-metal alloy and were still sharp when disinterred. Little of the tomb itself, discovered in the 1970s, has yet been excavated, though two grand bronze four-horsed chariots were dug up in the 1980s. High levels of mercury contamination in the ground may confirm an account in Sima Qian’s Annals of the Grand Historian claiming that the tomb boasted artificial rivers of flowing mercury.\n\nPompeii (Italy) The sudden eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 buried the Roman town of Pompeii (and nearby Herculanaeum) so completely and quickly that the towns remained remarkably intact until they were unearthed in modern times. Notable sites in Pompeii include the House of the Faun, whose Alexander Mural features a much-reproduced depiction of Alexander the Great; the Villa of the Mysteries, whose red murals depict a cult initiation ceremony; the Lupanar, a brothel where graffiti survives intact on its walls; and the Garden of the Fugitives, where plaster casts preserve the poses of human remains found there, as if frozen in time by the eruption.\n\nSutton Hoo (England) Sutton Hoo, an area near the North Sea coast in eastern England, is a complex of two cemeteries and numerous burial mounds (or tumuli) discovered in 1938 that provide insight to the early Anglo-Saxon settlers of England. Sutton Hoo’s ship burial yielded a cache of grave goods that invited many comparisons to passages in Beowulf. While the interred ship had long since decayed, it left behind a uniform negative impression of colored soil, allowing scholars to determine its size and shape. The ship burial may have honored the East Anglian king Raedwald, but this theory is not universally accepted. Among the site’s finest treasures are intricate, bejeweled garnet-and-gold clasps and buckles for clothes and satchels, including a precious purse lid. An icon of the site itself is the iron-and-bronze Sutton Hoo helmet, which is topped with a small dragon figurine and has a face mask adorned with eyebrows and a mustache.\n\nChichén Itzá (Mexico) The Mayan city of Chichén Itzá was established in the 6th century AD on the Yucatán Peninsula. Structures such as the Akabtzib (“House of Dark Writing”) were built by the city’s original settlers, who were displaced by invaders around the 10th century during the much-debated “post-classical Mayan collapse.” These invaders built the city’s Temple of Kukulkan (also known as El Castillo), a grand Mesoamerican pyramid whose four sides each have 91-step stairways (which, when including the shared top platform, sum to 365 steps, one for each day of the year). Chichén Itzá also hosts a court for the Mesoamerican ballgame decorated with low-relief images of human sacrifices. Sacrifice also occurred in the city’s largest cenote (natural underground well), with people (and jade treasures) cast into it to appease the rain god Chaac.\n\nL’Anse Aux Meadows (Canada) Rediscovered at the very northern tip of Newfoundland in the 1960s, L’Anse aux Meadows serves as concrete proof that Norse seafarers were the first Europeans to reach North America (excluding Greenland). The site, established around AD 1000, may in fact be Straumfjord, a town built in “Vinland” according to the Saga of Erik the Red. The presence of many rivets strongly suggests that it, at least in part, was a ship repair depot, and the presence of butternut seeds proves the Norse traveled at least to New Brunswick or met native traders from there. The main edifices at L’Anse aux Meadows were built from sod, with dirt walls and turf roofs. Its foundry was where the earliest known iron-working occurred in the New World."

    "title": "Historical Fashions",
    "content": "The hennin (mid- to late 15th century) The hennin was a tall, roughly conical hat worn by ladies beginning in the mid-15th century. Though it has become emblematic of “fairy tale” costumes, the hennin was very popular in France and (particularly) Burgundy, whose control of Flemish ports and manufacturing hubs brought easy access to luxury fabrics. To a lesser extent, the hennin was also worn in England and in the German domains. The hennin was always worn with fine silk or gauze draping down from its top. Though the long, pointed cone was the most popular style, several variants are widely seen in medieval art and early Renaissance portraiture, including the truncated hennin (with a shape often compared to an inverted flowerpot) and curved, yard-long hennins that resembled elaborate horns (which were denounced by moralists for its diabolical connotations). In all cases, the hennin was worn high and back on the head in conjunction with the enduring fashion of the high plucked hairline.\n\nThe French hood and gable hood (early to late 16th century) In contrast with the extravagant hennin, the hood was a subtler, smaller head covering for the upper classes that entered fashion in the first decade of the 16th century and remained popular (especially among older ladies) until the very end of that century. Pearls were a common embellishment. There were two main styles: the gable hood, which was popular in England and had a quasi-pentagonal, angled shape that covered most of the head down to the ears; and the French hood, which was more popular in France and curved backward atop the head to expose much of the hair. The French hood later subsumed the gable hood in popularity, even in England. Hoods are extremely common in art from the era, especially in portraits of Henry VIII’s wives and the other Tudor queens.\n\nThe men’s wig (1650s to 1800s) The wig became a core element of men’s European fashion in the 1620s when France’s Louis XIII went bald young and began wearing wigs, a practice his son Louis XIV continued. Britain resisted this continental fashion until the Restoration, when Charles II (who had been in exile in France) proudly wore wigs at court. These wigs, while massive and wide, originally mimicked natural hair color; by the 1750s, the standard male wig was less elaborate, often had a short ponytail-like queue, and was white to better match the white powder used to maintain it. The male wig fell out of fashion in the 1800s for two chief reasons: the first was a severe English tax on wig powder passed in 1795; the second was that wigs, a symbol of royalty, became distasteful amidst the rise of populist republics in America and France. (This, however, did not stop early American presidents such as John Adams and James Monroe from wearing the wigs that had been fashionable when they were younger.)\n\nThe kilt (mid-17th century onward) Contrary to common depictions in film and television, the Scottish kilt did not exist in the medieval era. The great kilt (an immense garment that wraps around the waist and is then wrapped up around the shoulder) came about first, with the more recognizable small kilt (waist-only) arising in the early 18th century. The practice of wearing the kilt in Scotland caught on immediately, and it became so quickly and deeply tied to Scottish identity that, after Britain crushed the nationalist Jacobite Rising of 1745, the kilt was banned under the Dress Act for four decades. The kilt was revived in the 1820s when the fashion-obsessed George IV wore one in public, and it became heavily romanticized. It was not until this later 19th-century revival that clan-specific tartan patterns developed and myths arose regarding who was “allowed” to wear certain tartans.\n\nCrinoline and hoop skirts (mid-19th century) Structured ladies’ skirts had always been around to some extent (such as the wide-hipped dresses and panniers of the Rococo era), but in the 1840s, European women began layering underskirt upon underskirt beneath dresses to create a slim-waisted, bell-shaped silhouette called “crinoline” (after crin, a common fabric in the underskirts). Crinoline exploded in popularity in 1856 with the patenting of cage crinoline, a rigid, light, lattice-like underskirt; this did away with the heavy multi-layering method, allowing crinoline to be affordable for all social classes and resulting in super-wide hoop skirts. Crinoline could sometimes prove hazardous: hundreds of women died from their hoop skirts draping into fireplaces and catching fire. Crinoline is now emblematic of the early Victorian era (and of Antebellum society in the U.S.). In the 1870s crinoline and hoop skirts faded in popularity but lived on as the vastly minimized bustle, which extended only from the backside.\n\nThe Victorian corset (mid-19th century to early 20th century) Like structured skirts, corsets in some form were part of women’s dress for centuries, but beginning in the 1820s, tight-laced corsets became near-compulsory in women’s fashion. By the mid-19th century, after crinoline fell from fashion, the “wasp waist” was seen as ideal (though the oft-cited ideal of the 18″ waistline may be an exaggeration or myth), and it was achieved through very tight cinching of whalebone corsets. From its outset, tight-laced corsetry was known to be unhealthy, and many newspapers of the time ran articles denouncing its excesses. Still, the corset remained ubiquitous at the turn of the century, when it was core to the all-American “Gibson girl” ideal. It was only the wholesale social changes brought on by World War I that caused the corset to vanish from everyday dress.\n\nReform dress (mid-19th century) The controversy over corsets coincided with the first wave of feminism in Europe, and many activists proposed alternatives that were collectively called “reform dress.” In the 1850s, Amelia Jenks Bloomer, an American feminist, advocated for a loose feminine trouser suit known by her name—“bloomers” or the “bloomer suit”—but constant ridicule led to its abandonment. In that same decade, “Artistic Dress” arose among followers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who favored looser, medieval-inspired garb. Reform dress was typically viewed as extreme, as it played into growing worries about women’s emancipation thanks to industrialization and the bicycle. Ultimately, outside of the emancipation waist (a bodice undergarment of strong fabric), no element of “reform dress” achieved anything more than fleeting use outside activist circles.\n\nFlapper fashion (1910s–1930) The term “flapper” originally referred to a vivacious teenage girl, but by the late 1910s it came to identify impetuous young women who flouted long-standing gender norms. In particular, the “flapper” wore short skirts (above the knee), cut her hair short into a bob, and enjoyed conventionally masculine pastimes, which at the time were as innocuous as driving a car, smoking, and drinking hard liquor. The aesthetics of jazz clubs also played into the flapper image, as did contemporary mainstream fashion items such as cloche hats (bell-shaped hats that cup close to the face) and heavy use of rouge, eyeliner, and lipstick. Though it had analogs in Europe and the U.K., the flapper was chiefly an American phenomenon closely tied to the prosperity of the Roaring Twenties; its appeal evaporated amidst the austerity of the Great Depression.\n\nThe bikini (1946 to today) The bikini debuted at a time when women’s swimsuits were usually a generous top paired with high-rise shorts that bared some midriff. Designed by Louis Reard for a swimsuit fashion show in Paris in 1946, the bikini was an instant controversy, as it was little more than string briefs paired with a bra. Reard named the garment after the Bikini Atoll, where the U.S. held atomic bomb tests less than a week prior. The bikini was a hit at the Paris show but proved too shocking to mainstream culture. In the 1950s, it was often worn by movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe or fashion models as publicity stunts; it was not until 1962, when Ursula Andress wore an iconic white bikini in a scene in the first James Bond film, Dr. No, that the bikini gained mainstream acceptance."

    "title": "Works By Leonardo Da Vinci",
    "content": "Leonardo’s Left Angel in Verrocchio’s The Baptism of Christ (ca. 1475) is among the earliest works attributed to the Renaissance master. Leonardo was an apprentice in the workshop of the Florentine artist Andrea del Verrocchio, and was asked to add the angel to Verrocchio’s painting of The Baptism of Christ, as it was common practice for students to complete less important sections of a teacher’s paintings. The contrast between the subtlety of color and minute detail in Leonardo’s angel, as compared to the other figures, is striking; scholars also speculate Leonardo painted much of the background, as it—like the angel—was done in oil rather than tempera. According to a fanciful (but almost certainly apocryphal) story from biographer Giorgio Vasari, after seeing Leonardo’s angel, Verrocchio snapped his paintbrushes in half and swore off painting for the rest of his life.\n\nThe Annunciation (ca. 1475) is Leonardo’s earliest major complete canvas, and was completed—like his angel—while he was still a student in Verrocchio’s workshop. The painting, currently held in Florence’s Uffizi Gallery, shows an open, outdoor courtyard in Tuscany, where on the right the Virgin Mary reads from an open book and raises her hand in greeting to the kneeling angel Gabriel on the left, who holds a lily and tells Mary that she will bear the Christ child. While still bearing characteristics of an early work, elements of the painting’s composition were revolutionary for their time, including the use of a single central vanishing point. Leonardo likely based the table on which the Virgin’s book rests on a tomb Verrocchio had sculpted for the Medici family. The angel Gabriel’s wings were initially quite small; they were later enlarged by an artist other than Leonardo.\n\nThe Portrait of Ginevra de’ Benci (ca. late 1470s) is the only one of Leonardo’s works held in the United States; it is part of the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Ginevra de’ Benci was a notable Florentine noblewoman; the painting was likely commissioned to celebrate her engagement to Luigi di Bernardo Niccolini. At one point, the painting also showed Ginevra’s arms and lower chest; however, the lower portion was at some point cut off, leaving the modern, nearly square version. The contrast between the portrait and the later Mona Lisa is striking; instead of smiling, Ginevra looks out from the canvas with a dispassionate, flat expression, thought by many scholars to be a reference to her intelligence. Ginevra sits in front of a juniper bush, a reference to both her virtue and her name.\n\nThe Virgin of the Rocks (or Madonna of the Rocks) exists in two versions. The earlier of the two, painted in the 1480s likely entirely by Leonardo, is held in the Louvre; the second version, likely painted in the first decade of the 1500s, is held in London, and much debate exists on how much of it was completed by Leonardo’s assistants instead of the master. The painting gets its name from the rocky outcropping that comprises the background to a scene showing the Virgin Mary, the infants Jesus and John the Baptist, and an angel. While the major components and composition of the two paintings are the same, they differ in the specific colors used and in the angel’s pose and gaze. The work was originally commissioned as the central panel of an altarpiece in Milan’s Church of San Francesco Grande (demolished in the early 19th century).\n\nThe Great Horse for Ludovico Sforza (worked on during the 1480s–1490s), also known as Leonardo’s Horse or the Sforza Horse, was a planned but never completed massive statue. In 1481 Leonardo left Florence for Milan, where he was employed by Duke Ludovico Sforza; among the duke’s earliest commissions for Leonardo was for a 25-foot-tall statue of a horse intended as a monument to the duke’s father. Leonardo spent over a decade planning the work, including designing new processes to cast it, as a bronze work of that size had never before been attempted. In 1493 Leonardo completed a full-size clay model of the sculpture; however, an invasion by French king Charles VIII halted work on the actual statue, and Leonardo’s clay model was eventually destroyed. In the late 20th century, sculptor Nina Akamu created a design based on Leonardo’s work that was cast and finally unveiled in 1999.\n\nVitruvian Man (ca. 1490) is an ink-on-paper drawing showing two superimposed nude male figures—one standing straight up and touching the edges of a square, the other with splayed legs and raised arms touching the edge of a circle (with the figure’s navel at the circle’s center). The work’s name indicates Leonardo’s source of inspiration in creating it: Vitruvius was an ancient Roman architect whose writings about using human proportions in his designs led Leonardo to investigate those proportions. Leonardo’s written comments about said proportions appear above and below the drawing (such as that the fingertip-to-fingertip distance between one’s outstretched hands is equal to one’s height). Other details in the drawing were included to examine other proportions, such as one foot of each figure being drawn straight on, with the other being turned to the side.\n\nLady with an Ermine (ca. 1490) is a portrait of Cecilia Gallerani. Leonardo completed this painting during his time in Milan working for the Sforzas; Gallerani was one of Ludovico’s mistresses. The portrait shows Cecilia turning her head over her left shoulder while wearing a blue and red dress—colors also often used for the clothing of the Virgin Mary. In her arms, she cradles an ermine or stoat, a white weasel depicted larger than the actual real-life animal, and likely symbolizing Cecilia’s purity or chastity. At some point in the 1700s, the painting’s original background was covered with a flat black layer, and the name “Leonardo d’Awinci” and title “La Belle Ferronnière” added to the painting’s upper left corner—leading to much confusion with Leonardo’s actual other painting known as La Belle Ferronnière, thought to depict another of Ludovico’s mistresses.\n\nThe Last Supper (ca. 1498) is a mural painted on the refectory (or dining room) wall in Milan’s Santa Maria della Grazie, a Dominican convent. Because Leonardo painted the work using tempera directly onto a completed wall with a simple undercoat—as opposed to painting it as a fresco on wet plaster—the painting almost immediately began to decay; it has been restored several times throughout its life, to the point where very little, if any, of Leonardo’s original work remains. The composition of the painting has been the subject of much analysis: Christ’s announcement of his imminent betrayal has caused his apostles to fearfully confer in four groups of three, completely contrasting with Christ’s calm demeanor. Judas is portrayed with his head lower than anyone else’s, spilling over the salt, indicating he is the traitor. The Last Supper has inspired many conspiracy theories, including that the apostle John is actually meant to be Mary Magdalene, and that the position of everyone’s hands forms a musical composition.\n\nThe Mona Lisa (ca. 1503–1517) is not only Leonardo’s most recognizable painting, it is arguably the single most famous piece of art in the world. The Mona Lisa, also known as La Gioconda, is thought to depict Lisa, the wife of silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family; he carried it with him wherever he went, and continued sporadically working on it until just before his death. The work is renowned for its subject’s enigmatic smile, and seems to be looking directly at the viewer no matter where they are positioned. In 1911, Vincenzo Peruggia stole the painting from the Louvre—a task made more difficult by Leonardo having painted the work on a wood panel, rather than canvas—and hid it for two years, claiming he wished to return the painting to Italy. The Mona Lisa has inspired numerous works of both tribute and parody; Marcel Duchamp’s work L.H.O.O.Q. consists of a postcard of the Mona Lisa with facial hair added.\n\nSaint John the Baptist (ca. 1515–1517) is likely Leonardo’s last completed work; he finished it just a few years before his death in 1519. The work shows John the Baptist tilting his head and smiling secretively at the viewer, clutching furs and a cross to his chest while curling his right arm to point upward. The model for John the Baptist was Salaì, Leonardo’s pupil and longtime companion. Many modern scholars have theorized that Leonardo and Salaì were lovers, and that the intimate nature of the painting represents their relationship. Leonardo’s portrait of John the Baptist is among the best examples of his signature use of sfumato (from the Italian word for “smoke”), a technique of blending colors to create a soft and smooth transition between them."

    "title": "Jewish-american Authors",
    "content": "Isaac Asimov (1920–1992) is considered one of the “Big Three” science fiction writers alongside Arthur C. Clarke and Robert Heinlein. His Robot series (1940–1995), which includes 37 short stories and six novels, opens with the smaller collection I, Robot, which centers on the robopsychologist Dr. Susan Calvin and her accounts of her life’s work to reporters. The collection introduces his Three Laws of Robotics: robots may not injure a human or allow them to be harmed; robots must obey a human’s orders; and robots must protect their existence. Asimov’s other well-known works include the Foundation series (1942–1993), in which the fall of the human Galactic Empire is mitigated by the work of the “psychohistorian” Hari Seldon, and such short stories as “The Last Question” (1956) and “Nightfall” (1941).\n\nSaul Bellow (1915–2005) was born to Jewish parents in Montreal and wrote many works about Jewish life, though he often rejected the label of “Jewish writer.” His novel Herzog (1964) centers on Moses E. Herzog, a divorced Jewish professor who debates killing his second wife, Madeleine, and her new husband, Valentine, to gain custody of his daughter Junie. In the picaresque novel The Adventures of Augie March (1953), Bellow wrote about a Chicago-born “everyman” who marries Stella, whom he meets in Mexico after teaching an eagle how to catch iguanas with Thea Fenchel. In Humboldt’s Gift (1975), Bellow fictionalized himself as Charlie Citrine, the protégé of the writer Von Humboldt Fleisher, a stand-in for Bellow’s own mentor, the Jewish poet Delmore Schwartz. At age 85, Bellow wrote Ravelstein (2000), in which the dying title Jewish man Abe Ravelstein tells his life story to the narrator, who catches a tropical disease in the Caribbean before deciding to write Ravelstein’s memoir.\n\nMichael Chabon (1963–) has explored his Jewish identity in novels such as The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay (2000). The title Jewish cousins, Joe Kavalier and Sammy Klayman, work at Empire Comics and create a character called the Escapist, who is voiced by the fictional actor Tracy Bacon, as well as Luna Moth, based on the bohemian Rosa Saks. In the novel, Kavalier comes to the US to live with Sammy after he escapes Nazi-occupied Prague by hiding in a coffin with a golem. The Yiddish Policemen’s Union (2007) focuses on Meyer Landsman, who works with Berko Shemets in a Jewish refugee settlement in Alaska to investigate threats to blow up the Dome of the Rock. He also wrote The Final Solution (2004), which centers on a beekeeper and retired detective (implied to be Sherlock Holmes) who searches for the parrot of Jewish refugee Linus Steinman.\n\nEmma Lazarus (1849–1887) was a Jewish author and activist best known for her sonnet “The New Colossus” (1883), which was written to raise money for the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal and is now inscribed on a plaque in the pedestal itself. The poem opens “not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,” describing how Liberty cries out “give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” The poem, which was etched onto the statue’s pedestal, was inspired partly by her advocacy for Jewish refugees subject to persecution in Russia. Lazarus also wrote “In the Jewish Synagogue at Newport” (1871) as a rebuttal to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s “The Jewish Cemetery at Newport.”\n\nPhilip Roth (1933–2018) created the fictional Jewish character Nathan Zuckerman, often considered Roth’s alter ego, who appears in novels such as American Pastoral (1997). The novel focuses on Seymour “The Swede” Levov, who runs a glove factory in Newark and has a daughter who converts to Jainism after she bombs a post office to protest the Vietnam War. In Portnoy’s Complaint (1969), Roth wrote about the “nice Jewish boy” Alexander Portnoy, who monologues to his psychoanalyst Dr. Spielvogel about his parents Sophie and Jack, as well as his relationships with women he nicknames “The Monkey” (Mary Jane Reed) and “The Pumpkin.” Roth’s The Human Stain (2000), also narrated by Nathan Zuckerman, is about the Classics professor Coleman Silk, who was fired for using a racial slur, even though he is a Black man passing as white. Roth explored Jewish identity in short stories such as “The Conversion of the Jews” and “Defender of the Faith” in his short story collection Goodbye, Columbus (1959), which shares its title with a novella about Neil Klugman. Rising antisemitism forms the backdrop of Roth’s The Plot Against America (2004), an alternative history novel in which Charles Lindbergh defeats Franklin D. Roosevelt for president, leading to the increased persecution of Jews.\n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer (1904–1991) was a Polish-born American short story author who wrote many works in Yiddish, drawing from the writings of earlier Yiddish authors such as Sholem Aleichem. Singer, who emigrated to the US in 1935 and worked for the Jewish Daily Forward, is perhaps best known for “Gimpel the Fool” (1953), in which the title breadmaker marries the unfaithful Elka and is told by the devil to urinate in the village’s bread to get revenge on his neighbors. “Gimpel the Fool,” like “The Spinoza of Market Street” and many more of Singer’s stories, is set in a fictionalized version of the Polish town of Frampol. His story “Yentl, the Yeshiva Boy,” about a young woman who disguises herself as a boy to study at a yeshiva, was adapted into a 1983 film starring Barbra Streisand. Singer also wrote the novel Satan in Goray (1933), about the title village amid the Khmelnitsky Uprising in Poland.\n\nBernard Malamud (1914–1986) was a Brooklyn-born author best known for his novel The Natural (1952). The novel centers on the baseball player Roy Hobbs, who tragically splits his prized bat “Wonderboy” in half. Hobbs plays for the New York Knights, which is managed by Pop Fisher. In the novel, Hobbs is shot by Harriet Byrd with a silver bullet, leading him to retire for 15 years, though during this time, he longs for Iris Lemon despite dating Memo Paris. Malamud more directly explored Judaism and antisemitism in his novel The Fixer (1966), an adaptation of the real-life story of Menahem Mendel Beilis, in which the handyman Yakov Bok is falsely accused of ritually killing a Christian boy during Passover and is tortured in tsarist Russia. Malamud is also known for “The Jewbird” (1963), a short story about a crow named Schwartz who endures antisemitism.\n\nChaim Potok (1929–2002) was an author and rabbi who sold over 3.4 million copies of his novel The Chosen (1967), which centers on the Hasidic boy Danny Saunders and the Orthodox boy Reuven Malter. The novel follows Danny’s decision to become a Freudian psychologist against the wishes of his rabbi father, while Reuven becomes a rabbi years after he is hit in the eye by a baseball. Potok’s other novels include My Name is Asher Lev (1972), whose title character distresses his traditionalist Hasidic father Aryeh by studying painting under Jacob Kahn and depicting his mother Rivkeh in his painting “Brooklyn Crucifixion,” and The Promise (1969), a sequel to The Chosen that centers Reuven and Danny amid post-World War II New York.\n\nArthur Miller (1915–2005) was born to a Polish-Jewish family in Harlem and achieved success with plays such as Death of a Salesman (1949) about the decline of Willy Loman, who crashes his car to provide insurance money for his wife Linda and his sons Biff and Happy after he is fired from his job and becomes obsessed with his own dreams. Miller’s play The Crucible (1953) is a depiction of the Salem witch trials written as an allegory for McCarthyism, in which John Proctor and Giles Corey are among those executed after Abigail Williams accuses many citizens of Salem of participating in witchcraft. Miller’s All My Sons (1947) is about Joe Keller, whose decision to sell faulty airplane pilots to the Air Force during World War II causes the imprisonment of his partner Steve Deever, the deaths of 21 pilots, and the suicide of his son Larry. After the Fall (1964), which is set entirely within the mind of its protagonist Quentin, was directly inspired by Miller’s divorce from Marilyn Monroe.\n\nNeil Simon (1927–2018) was a Jewish-American playwright from New York City who grew up during the Great Depression, which framed some of his plays. Simon is best known for The Odd Couple (1965), which depicts the lazy Oscar Madison and his neat roommate Felix Ungar, who go on a disastrous double date with Cecily and Gwendolyn Pigeon. Simon won the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for Lost in Yonkers (1990), in which Arty and Jay Kurnitz live with their mentally challenged Aunt Bella and attempt to steal money from their grandmother, a store owner. Simon’s semi-autobiographical Eugene trilogy tells the story of Eugene Jerome, whose New York childhood, World War II basic training, and early comedy career are respectively chronicled in Brighton Beach Memoirs (1983), Biloxi Blues (1985), and Broadway Bound (1986)."

In the early 2020s, Apple began designing its own line of Apple Silicon processors for its computers, based on the ARM instruction set (more common in smartphones and tablets).\n\nThe motherboard is a large printed circuit board connecting all of the main components of a computer. A typical motherboard will contain, at the very least, a socket for the CPU, multiple slots to insert RAM, slots in which to insert a graphics card and/or other expansion cards, connectors for storage drives, and an I/O panel that is available on the back of the case, which contains plugs for external peripherals, USB devices, networking ports, and more. A motherboard’s chipset manages the communication between a computer’s components, which occurs via the motherboard’s integrated circuits. In the 1990s and early 2000s, it was common for most desktops to have a separate sound card to manage sound output; since the early 2000s, most motherboards have had integrated sound, largely eliminating sound cards except in specialized applications.\n\nRAM (random access memory) is a form of memory used to store data a computer expects to need within a short amount of time. Modern RAM comes in sticks called DIMMs (dual inline memory modules). RAM generally stores information based on whether capacitors are charged or uncharged. RAM is volatile memory, meaning that any information stored in it is lost when the computer is shut down or powered off (unlike information stored on a hard drive). Nearly all RAM in modern desktop computers is SDRAM (synchronous dynamic RAM), meaning that an external clock cycle controls the speed at which information is written to and read from the RAM, which must be refreshed at certain intervals. Most modern desktop RAM also uses the DDR (double data rate) standard, meaning that data can be read or written twice within a single clock cycle. The speed of RAM is also partially measured by its CAS (column address strobe) latency, the number of clock cycles between when data is requested and received.\n\nHard drives (HDDs) are non-volatile devices for storing data, meaning that the data is not lost when the computer is turned off. By and large, hard drives still operate on the same basic principles as when they were first developed in the 1950s: data is magnetically written onto a number of fast-spinning metal plates or disks. Hard drives remain the cheapest used storage solution per unit of data (among solutions used commonly for general purposes). Most modern desktop computers will include at least one hard drive for bulk data storage, though it will likely not be the system’s primary drive. Nearly all modern desktop hard drives are of the 3.5″ size, spin at 5400 or 7200 RPM, and connect to the motherboard via a SATA cable.\n\nSolid state drives (SSDs) are non-volatile devices that store data on flash memory, which utilizes transistors. Because the drive essentially uses electricity, rather than physically spinning media, to store information, SSD read/write speeds are much faster than those of hard drives, but they are also more expensive: a 2-terabyte SSD may cost around $200, while the same amount of money may purchase an 8-terabyte hard drive. SSDs first began to be widely adopted in the consumer market in the early 2010s. There are currently two main types of SSDs: 2.5″ drives, which connect to the motherboard with a SATA cable (like hard drives); and M.2 NVME drives, which are the size of a stick of gum, connect directly to a slot on the motherboard, and represent the fastest easily available non-volatile consumer storage solution today. Most modern computers will include at least one SSD as the main drive on which the operating system is installed, allowing for much faster boot times than a hard drive.\n\nA graphics card, containing a GPU, generates the visual images that are output to a monitor. Nearly all computers designed for gaming will use a discrete graphics card; systems for general business purposes and most non-gaming laptops instead use integrated graphics, meaning the CPU also acts as the GPU. The two main manufacturers of discrete consumer graphics cards are Nvidia (with its GeForce cards) and AMD (with its Radeon cards); beginning in 2022, Intel also began manufacturing discrete GPUs with its Arc line of products. A modern discrete graphics card will include its own processing unit (the actual graphics processing unit, or GPU), as well as several gigabytes of dedicated RAM. Nvidia’s development of CUDA technology in the 2000s allowed for GPU processing power to be used by other applications. Over the past decade, this has led to a spike in GPU prices and numerous shortages of available products, as GPUs have become critical to both cryptocurrency mining and generative AI.\n\nThe power supply unit (PSU) supplies power to all other components of a computer by converting the alternating current from an outlet into direct current. Power supplies are rated by both how many watts of power they are able to provide a system, and their 80 Plus rating—a measure of the efficiency of their power delivery; for example, an 850 Gold PSU can deliver up to 850 watts of power at between 87 and 90 percent efficiency under load. Modern power supplies for enthusiast desktops are often modular, meaning that the user only needs to connect cables for the components that they need or have—reducing the amount of cable clutter within a case. While power supplies deliver different voltages for different components, by far the most important is the 12-volt rail, as the most power-hungry of a system’s components—the CPU and GPU—use it.\n\nPCI Express (Peripheral Component Interface Express or PCIe) is a connection standard used for computer hardware. First developed in 2003, PCIe began life as a new standard for connecting graphics cards that replaced the older, slower AGP (Acceleratic Graphics Port) standard. However, its speed and versatility meant that soon it became the standard for all sorts of components, including sound cards and other expansion cards; modern M.2 NVME drives also utilize PCIe. PCIe operates on a number of lanes for transmitting data, from one to 16; most modern GPU slots utilize a 16-lane connection. Because of PCIe’s ubiquity, it is common for both the CPU and motherboard chipset to include separate PCIe controllers that are linked to different inputs; it is also, consequently, possible to install so many PCIe devices on one controller that it limits the available lanes and reduces performance.\n\nThe BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is the first piece of software that runs upon powering on a computer. Although the terms “BIOS” and “UEFI” technically refer to different things (BIOS being an older IBM standard that has been superseded by UEFI), the terms are still commonly used interchangeably. The BIOS performs a computer’s POST (power-on self test), ensuring all hardware components are functioning, and manages the boot order, determining which drive/operating system will be given priority to run. Updating a computer’s BIOS (known as flashing the BIOS) was once a process fraught with danger, as if the computer was turned off or otherwise lost power, the BIOS could be corrupted and render the system completely unusable; most modern motherboards, however, include a BIOS flashback feature that allows the BIOS to be updated or reloaded in any situation, even if the system doesn’t have a CPU.\n\nCooling a desktop computer is a complicated but important task. Modern CPUs and GPUs generate an enormous amount of heat (running at 70°C to 80°C under load with adequate cooling) that must be dissipated for the system to continue to run. There are two main types of modern CPU coolers. An air cooler typically features a very large heatsink (a mass of thermally conductive metal attached directly to the CPU), with fans blowing over it constantly to exhaust the heat it draws away from the CPU. A liquid cooler passes a coolant fluid over a cold plate in contact with the CPU to draw the heat into the liquid, then pumps the liquid through a radiator for heat exchange. A system will also include multiple case fans to maximize the flow of cool air into, and warm air out of, the case. Failing to adequately cool a system can result in thermal throttling, when a component intentionally lowers its performance level to avoid reaching and/or running at dangerous temperatures."

    "title": "Techniques In Biotechnology",
    "content": "PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a technique used to amplify small segments of DNA. It allows scientists to generate millions of copies of a specific DNA sequence from a small initial sample. Developed by Kary Mullis in 1983, PCR involves repeated cycles of heating and cooling, performed using an instrument called a thermal cycler (or thermocycler). PCR is divided into three steps. First, denaturation heats a double-stranded DNA template, separating the two strands. Second, annealing lowers the temperature, allowing short single-stranded DNA strands called primers to bind to the template. Finally, extension allows DNA polymerase to extend the attached primers along the template. Taq polymerase, a DNA polymerase isolated from the bacteria Thermus aquaticus, is commonly used in PCR due to its heat stability. Variants of PCR include real-time PCR (or qPCR), which allows the amount of amplified product to be measured in real time, as well as reverse transcription PCR (or RT-PCR), which allows for quantification of RNA by converting RNA into complementary DNA prior to amplification.\n\nGel electrophoresis is used to separate nucleic acids or proteins based on their size and charge. It provides information on the size and quantity of DNA or protein fragments, enabling scientists to confirm the presence of specific genetic sequences or proteins. During gel electrophoresis, DNA, RNA, or protein samples are loaded into a gel matrix, such as agarose or polyacrylamide, and an electric current is applied. Molecules migrate through the gel, with smaller fragments moving faster than larger ones. During separation, buffers such as TAE (Tris-Acetate-EDTA) and TBE (Tris-Borate-EDTA) maintain pH, provide ions for conduction, and preserve sample stability. After separation, bands are visualized using staining methods such as ethidium bromide for nucleic acids or Coomassie brilliant blue for proteins. If the experiment is run alongside a set of molecules with known sizes called a ladder, the resulting bands may be compared against the ladder to determine the size of the fragments. SDS-PAGE is a variant of gel electrophoresis in which proteins are denatured using SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), conferring a uniform negative charge to all fragments and allowing for separation by size alone.\n\nDNA sequencing is the process of determining the exact order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule. The first breakthrough in the field, Sanger sequencing, was developed by Frederick Sanger in 1977 and utilizes dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), which terminate DNA strand elongation when incorporated. A DNA sample is then subjected to denaturation, annealing, and elongation, with ddNTPs creating a set of fragments of varying lengths, each ending with a labeled ddNTP. In contrast, shotgun sequencing randomly fragments DNA strands, sequences those fragments into reads, then reassembles overlapping reads to recover the full sequence. Modern advancements in DNA sequencing include next-generation sequencing (or NGS) technologies, which allow for rapid, high-throughput sequencing of entire genomes. Industry leaders in next-generation sequencing include the US-based Illumina, who utilizes dye sequencing to facilitate massive parallel sequencing, as well as the UK-based Oxford Nanopore Technologies, whose nanopore sequencing method passes DNA samples through pores and measures changes in electric current across the pore.\n\nNorthern blotting is a technique used to detect and study specific RNA molecules within a sample. Developed by James Alwine, David Kemp, and George Stark in 1977, it allows scientists to determine the size, abundance, and expression patterns of RNA. The process begins with the extraction of RNA from a biological sample, followed by its separation by size through gel electrophoresis. The separated RNA fragments are then blotted onto a nylon or nitrocellulose membrane. To detect specific RNA sequences, the membrane is hybridized with a labeled probe that is complementary to the target RNA. After hybridization, the membrane is washed to remove unbound probes, and the signal is detected using autoradiography or a similar detection method. Northern blotting is widely used in gene expression studies, allowing researchers to compare RNA levels across different tissues or developmental stages. It is particularly valuable in identifying and quantifying mRNA levels, providing insights into gene regulation.\n\nWestern blotting is a powerful analytical technique used to detect specific proteins in a complex mixture. Developed by W. Neal Burnette in 1981, this method allows scientists to determine the presence, size, and abundance of proteins. The process begins with the extraction of proteins from a sample, followed by their separation based on size using SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins are then blotted onto a membrane, typically made of nitrocellulose or PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride). To detect the target protein, the membrane is incubated with a primary antibody specific to the protein of interest. After washing away unbound primary antibodies, the membrane is incubated with a secondary antibody that recognizes the primary antibody and is conjugated to a detection enzyme or fluorescent tag. The presence of the target protein is then visualized using chemiluminescence, fluorescence, or colorimetric detection methods. Western blotting is widely used in molecular biology, biochemistry, and medical diagnostics to study protein expression, post-translational modifications, and protein-protein interactions.\n\nSouthern blotting is a method used to detect specific DNA sequences within a complex DNA sample. Developed by Edwin Southern in 1975, this technique enables researchers to identify, isolate, and study particular DNA fragments. The process begins with the extraction and restriction enzyme digestion of DNA. The resulting fragments are then separated by size using gel electrophoresis. The separated DNA is transferred onto a nylon or nitrocellulose membrane through capillary action, where the DNA fragments retain their relative positions. To detect specific sequences, the blotted membrane is hybridized with a labeled DNA probe complementary to the target sequence. After hybridization, the membrane is washed to remove unbound probes, and the signal is detected using autoradiography or a similar detection method. Southern blotting is commonly used in gene mapping, cloning verification, and genetic screening, providing valuable information about gene structure and organization as well as the presence of specific genetic elements.\n\nELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a widely used technique for detecting and quantifying specific proteins, antibodies, antigens, and hormones in a sample. Developed in the 1970s, ELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction. There are several types of ELISA, including direct, indirect, sandwich, and competitive, the most popular of which is sandwich ELISA. In a typical sandwich ELISA, the process begins by coating a microplate with a capture antibody specific to the target antigen. The sample is added, and any antigen present binds to the capture antibody. A detection antibody, which is also specific to the antigen and conjugated to an enzyme, is then added. After washing away unbound substances, a substrate for the enzyme is added, producing a measurable color change, fluorescence, or luminescence. The intensity of the signal correlates with the amount of target antigen in the sample. ELISA is highly sensitive and specific, making it a standard tool in clinical diagnostics, vaccine development, and research to measure biomarkers and disease-related molecules.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9 is a revolutionary genome-editing technology derived from a bacterial immune system. It allows precise modification of DNA within living organisms. Discovered in the early 2010s by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, the duo shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery. The system consists of two key components: the Cas9 enzyme and a guide RNA (gRNA). The gRNA is designed to match the target DNA sequence, guiding Cas9 to the specific location in the genome. Once there, Cas9 creates a double-strand break in the DNA. The cell’s natural repair mechanisms then kick in, either joining the ends back together through NHEJ (non-homologous end joining), which can introduce mutations, or through HDR (homology-directed repair), which uses a provided DNA template to insert new sequences. This precise targeting allows for gene knockout, insertion, or correction. In November 2018, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was controversially used by Chinese researcher He Jiankui to target the CCR5 gene in a pair of twins in an attempt to confer HIV resistance to them.\n\nFlow cytometry is a technique used to analyze the physical and chemical characteristics of cells or particles as they pass in a stream through a laser. Developed in the 1960s, this method labels cells with fluorescent markers that bind to specific cell components, such as proteins or nucleic acids. Techniques such as hydrodynamic focusing and acoustic focusing ensure cells remain in single file as they pass through the beam. As cells move through the laser, light emitted by fluorescent markers—along with forward-scattered light (FSC light) and side-scattered light (SSC light)—are captured by detectors. The resulting data is analyzed using techniques such as compensation and gating to determine cell size, granularity, and the presence of specific markers. Flow cytometry is often combined with fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) in the Flow-FISH technique, which is used to quantify the copy number of repetitive elements like telomeres. It is also widely used for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), as well as for immunophenotyping, cell counting, and biomarker detection.\n\nMolecular cloning is a technique used to create multiple copies of a specific DNA segment. It involves the insertion of a DNA fragment of interest into a vector, a DNA molecule capable of replication in a host organism, usually a plasmid. The process begins with the isolation of the DNA fragment to be cloned. The isolated DNA is then fragmented using restriction enzymes, while the selected vector is digested using the same restriction enzyme. The DNA fragments and vectors are mixed in the presence of DNA ligase. The resulting recombinant vector is introduced into a host cell, often a bacterium, through a process called transformation. As the host cell replicates, it also replicates the recombinant vector, producing multiple copies of the DNA fragment. Often, an antibacterial resistance gene is incorporated into the vector, allowing only cells that have taken up the vector to survive. The cloned DNA can then be isolated and used for various applications, such as gene expression studies, genetic engineering, and functional analysis."

    "title": "Organic Reactions",
    "content": "Redox reactions change the oxidation state of a compound by reducing or oxidizing it. A compound that is oxidized loses electrons, while a compound that is reduced gains electrons. In the context of organic molecules, an oxidation reaction tends to reduce the number of carbon–hydrogen bonds and increase the number of bonds between carbon and oxygen or other atoms, such as nitrogen, halogens, etc. Reduction reactions do the opposite, increasing carbon–hydrogen bonds and decreasing carbon–oxygen and carbon–other atom bonds. For example, the conversion of an alkene to an alkane increases the number of carbon–hydrogen bonds and is thus a reduction. Redox reactions can convert between useful functional groups such as alcohols, carbonyls, and carboxylic acid derivatives. Alcohols can be oxidized to carbonyls, which can be oxidized to carboxylic acid derivatives; the reverse order can occur through reduction reactions. Oxidation is frequently performed with chromium-based oxidants such as PCC or Jones’ reagent. Reductions are frequently performed with hydride reducing agents like sodium borohydride (Na B H4) or lithium aluminum hydride (Li Al H4).\n\nAddition reactions are a type of reaction in which two molecules combine to produce a larger molecule with no loss of atoms from either of the reactants. Organic addition reactions can be categorized as electrophilic or nucleophilic depending on whether the molecule being added has a group that accepts electron pairs (and thus “loves electrons” and is an electrophile) or if the molecule being added has a group that donates electron pairs to positively-charged nuclei (and thus “loves nuclei” and is a nucleophile). For example, in the electrophilic addition reaction between an alkene and molecular bromine (Br2), bromine acts as an electrophile, accepting electrons from the alkene, the nucleophile. Addition reactions to alkenes may be regioselective, meaning the added substituent may selectively prefer to bond to one of the two alkene carbon atoms over the other carbon atom; such regioselectivity can in many cases be described by Markovnikov’s rule.\n\nSubstitution reactions are a type of reaction in which one group on a larger molecule is replaced with a different group. The incoming group is usually a nucleophile, and the group that is replaced is called a leaving group. There are two basic types of substitution reactions, denoted SN2 (which stands for “bimolecular nucleophilic substitution”) and SN1 (which stands for “unimolecular nucleophilic substitution”). An SN2 reaction is called “bimolecular” and has a “2” in its abbreviation because its rate-determining step depends on two molecules, with the nucleophile attacking the leaving group via a backside attack. An SN1 reaction is called “unimolecular” and has a “1” in its abbreviation since its rate-determining step depends on one molecule: first, the leaving group leaves by itself spontaneously, forming an unstable carbocation intermediate, then the nucleophile comes in afterward. The Williamson ether synthesis is a typical substitution reaction; in it, an alcohol replaces the halogen in an alkyl halide via an SN2 mechanism, making an ether.\n\nElimination reactions are the opposite of an addition reaction: instead of two molecules coming together to form one molecule, two groups (or, more commonly, one group and a hydrogen atom) are removed from a molecule to form two molecules. The original molecule then usually is stabilized by the creation of a pi bond. This is most commonly observed to create alkenes by eliminating across a carbon–carbon single bond. Just like substitution reactions, basic elimination reactions come in E2 (bimolecular elimination) and E1 (unimolecular elimination) types. Like in SN2 reactions, in E2 reactions the reaction occurs in a single rate-determining step involving both molecules as the leaving group and the adjacent hydrogen leave at the same time. E2 reactions require an anti-periplanar arrangement of the leaving group and the exiting hydrogen to proceed. Like SN1 reactions, in E1 reactions the rate-determining step involves one molecule as the leaving group leaves spontaneously to form an unstable carbocation, then afterwards the hydrogen is removed to form the pi bond. Similar to Markovnikov’s rule for addition reactions, the regioselectivity of some elimination reactions obeys Zaitsev’s rule, in which the leaving hydrogen is removed from the carbon attached to the fewest hydrogens, thus creating the most substituted alkene.\n\nCondensation reactions are a type of reaction in which two molecules combine to form a single molecule, with the removal of a small molecule in the process (usually water, hence the name). A classic example of a condensation reaction is the Fischer esterification, in which a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to produce an ester. The Fischer esterification requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen in the carboxylic acid. Another condensation reaction is the aldol condensation, in which two carbonyl-containing compounds combine to form an alpha–beta unsaturated ketone, which means a ketone that is directly connected to an alkene. The aldol condensation can be catalyzed by either an acid or a base, with the acid generating an intermediate enol, or the base generating an intermediate enolate.\n\nHydrogenation is a special type of reduction reaction in which a molecule of hydrogen (H2) is added to an organic molecule. It is most typically used to convert alkenes (double bonds) to alkanes (single bonds). This is commonly used in the processing of fats, in which unsaturated fatty acids—which have double and triple bonds—are hydrogenated until they are saturated with hydrogen atoms, thus becoming saturated fats. Incomplete hydrogenation can lead to the production of trans alkenes, thus creating trans fats. William Knowles and Ryoji Noyori won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for independently developing stereoselective hydrogenation reactions. This essentially means that the reaction preferentially adds the hydrogens to a particular side of a molecule, forming a chiral molecule, a molecule that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. (Think about your left hand and right hand: if you move one of them over the other without rotating, the hands don’t overlap cleanly because your thumbs are on opposite sides. Your hands are chiral! These stereoselective reactions are capable of producing either only the left-handed molecule, or only the right-handed molecule.) Stereoselective hydrogenation can be used to make the drug L-DOPA, which is used to treat Parkinson’s disease.\n\nThe Diels–Alder reaction is a cycloaddition reaction that combines a diene and a dienophile to form a cyclic compound, typically a six-carbon cyclohexene ring. The dienophile is typically an alkene, but can also be another functional group with an appropriate pi bond (such as an alkyne). Due to the cyclic transition state of the Diels–Alder reaction, it belongs to the pericyclic class of reactions. The stereochemistry of a Diels–Alder reaction kinetically has a preference for the endo product, because that configuration maximizes the orbital overlap between the two reactants. Frontier molecular orbital theory can be used to describe the electron flow in a Diels–Alder reaction: electrons flow from the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) of the diene to the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the dienophile. This means that the Diels–Alder reaction can be accelerated by adding electron-donating groups (EDGs) to the diene and electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) to the dienophile.\n\nThe Wittig reaction converts carbonyls into alkenes. This is typically accomplished with a Wittig reagent, which is a phosphonium ylide, a type of molecule with a positively-charged phosphorus atom directly bonded to a negatively-charged carbon atom. The ylide can be made by taking an alkylated phosphonium salt and treating it with a strong organolithium base (like n-butyllithium). This ylide then reacts with the carbonyl to form a four-membered ring called an oxaphosphetane, which decomposes to give the product alkene, plus triphenylphosphine oxide as a side product. Wittig reactions typically produce (Z) alkenes, meaning the two largest substituents are on the same side of the double bond. The Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction is a modification of the Wittig reaction that employs “stabilized” ylides to instead produce (E) alkenes, in which the two largest substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\nElectrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions are substitution reactions that can replace groups on an aromatic ring like benzene. These use a different mechanism than SN2 or SN1, as aromatic carbons are difficult to nucleophilically attack. While there are six positions on a benzene ring to add a new substituent, you often only want to add the group to one position, which can be accomplished with the aid of directing groups. For example, the hydroxyl group in the molecule phenol is an ortho/para director, meaning the new group will be added either next to the hydroxyl (ortho), or on the opposite side of the ring to the hydroxyl (para). Nitro groups are meta-directors, which influence the addition of the new substituent two carbon atoms away from the nitro group (meta). The Friedel–Crafts reactions are a prominent example of an electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which an alkyl or acyl group is added to an aromatic ring. Friedel–Crafts reactions typically use a Lewis acid, such as aluminum trichloride, as a catalyst.\n\nCoupling reactions combine two molecules or fragments into one larger product, usually with the aid of organometallic reagents to form new carbon–carbon bonds (which are difficult to make, but desirable). The 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Akira Suzuki, Richard Heck, and Ei-ichi Negishi for developing coupling reactions named for them (the Suzuki coupling, the Negishi coupling, and the Heck reaction). All coupling reactions have a mechanism that contains a catalytic cycle, allowing for a very small amount of catalyst (usually a palladium complex) to propagate the reaction. Suzuki reactions usually couple a boronic ester to a vinyl or aryl halide, while Heck reactions couple an alkene to a vinyl or aryl halide."

    "title": "Ideas From Calculus",
    "content": "A limit is a value that a function approaches as the input approaches another value, even if the function is not equal to that output value (or even defined there). For example, the limit of 1/x as x gets infinity large (“approaches infinity”) is 0, even though the function never actually reaches 0. The definition of a limit is formalized in a way traditionally written with the Greek letters epsilon and delta, a technique developed by Augustin-Louis Cauchy.\n\nContinuity is informally defined as the ability of a function’s graph to be drawn without lifting the pen. Properly, a function is continuous at a given point if the function has a limit at that point and is equal to its limit there. It is also common to speak of “continuous functions,” which are functions that are continuous at every point. Polynomials are continuous, as are exponential and logarithmic functions, sine, and cosine. However, the other four trigonometric functions (cosecant, secant, tangent, and cotangent) are not continuous at some points (the ones at which their graphs have asymptotes), and rational functions generally have some points of discontinuity.\n\nThe derivative is an operation that takes a function and results in another function that gives the original function’s rate of change. Taking a derivative is called differentiation and is carried out with respect to the input variable that is changing. The derivative is calculated as the limit of a tangent line between two points on the function’s graph as the two points get arbitrarily close together. At any given point, the derivative’s value is equal to the slope of the tangent line to the function’s graph at that point. The derivative of a function f(x) is notated as f′(x) (Lagrange’s notation, pronounced “f prime of x”) or df/dx (Leibniz notation, pronounced “d f d x). Differentiation can be repeated, e.g,. differentiating a function twice gives its second derivative (f′′(x) or d²f/dx²).\n\nA function is called differentiable if its derivative can be evaluated. Like for continuity, this can be stated about a specific point or the whole function. The absolute value function is an example of a function that is differentiable in some places but not others: it is differentiable everywhere except at an input of 0, where its graph has a sharp corner. Differentiability is a stronger property than continuity: a function can only be differentiable if it is continuous, but it could be only continuous and not differentiable (the absolute value function being an example of that). If a function’s derivative can be taken infinitely many times, it is called smooth.\n\nDefinite integration is an operation that can be interpreted as giving the area under a curve, or more precisely, the signed area between the curve and the x-axis (signed area meaning that area below the axis counts as negative). An integral is denoted by a “long S” symbol, ∫. Definite integration is performed between two endpoints (e.g., the integral between 0 and 5), and those endpoints are written above and below, or next to, the integral symbol.\n\nRiemann sums are a way to formalize the definition of an integral. A Riemann sum approximates the area under a curve by partitioning the area into narrow rectangles that extend between the x-axis and the function’s graph, finding the areas of the rectangles, and adding those up. For well-behaved functions, the limit can be taken as the rectangles get infinitely thin, giving the definite integral.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus roughly states that integration and differentiation are opposite operations. This means that most basic rules for integration can be found by reversing the basic rules for differentiation given above. The formal statement of the theorem is usually given in two parts. The first part states that integrating a function gives an antiderivative of the function (i.e., a function whose derivative is the original function). The second part states that the definite integral of f(x) from a to b can be calculated as F(b) − F(a), where F is an antiderivative of f.\n\nThe chain rule is used to find the derivative of the composition of two functions, such as sin(x²). It states that the derivative of f(g(x)) is f′(g(x)) · g′(x). In Leibniz notation, it is written as df/dx = df/dg dg/dx and thus resembles canceling two fractions. Integrating both sides of this result gives a corresponding rule for integration by substitution.\n\nThe product rule is used to find the derivative of the product of two functions, such as x sin x. It states that the derivative of f(x) g(x) is f′(x) g(x) + f(x) g′(x). Integrating both sides of this result gives a corresponding rule for integrating the product of two functions, called integration by parts. It can be combined with the chain rule to find the quotient rule (the way to differentiate a function written as one function divided by another).\n\nTaylor series is a way of approximating a differentiable function using an infinite sum of monomials (which can be truncated to get a polynomial). Coefficients of Taylor series are found using nth derivatives and the factorial function. Taylor series can be based around any point of a function, and when the chosen point is x = 0, it is called a Maclaurin series. Taylor’s theorem gives a bound on the error resulting from truncating the Taylor series to a finite number of terms; the error can be expressed as a remainder term in the Lagrange form, Cauchy form, or integral form.\n\nDifferential equations are equations that relate a function to its derivatives, or even multiple derivatives (e.g., a function to its first and second derivatives). They are widely used throughout the sciences to model behavior like radioactive decay, population growth, predator-prey relations, waves, fluid flow, and more."

    "title": "Indigenous Peoples",
    "content": "Aboriginal Australians comprise various indigenous peoples who lived in Australia before European settlers arrived. Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples believed that Australia was created during a mythical period called the Dreamtime, during which beings like the Rainbow Serpent ruled. When the British arrived in Australia, they persecuted Aboriginal people and seized their land in the Frontier Wars. In the 1900s, many Aboriginal children were taken from their families, becoming known as the Stolen Generations. While European mistreatment of Aboriginal people is recognized on National Sorry Day, they still face discrimination, including higher rates of poverty and incarceration. Aboriginal people are distinct from the Torres Strait Islanders, who live north of mainland Australia.\n\nThe Ainu people are indigenous to Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s home islands. They also live in other northern Pacific areas like Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. For centuries, the Ainu traded with ethnically Japanese people on Honshu, but were conquered around 1800 by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Ainu people are generally taller than ethnically Japanese people and are set apart by their longer beards and distinctive facial tattoos, particularly among women. Traditional Ainu communities both hunted and worshiped bears, which are native to Hokkaido.\n\nThe Basque people are indigenous to northern Spain and southwestern France. Most live in the Basque Country (or Euskadi), a wealthy region within Spain that includes cities like Bilbao and San Sebastian. Many speak Basque, a language isolate that emerged earlier than even Proto-Indo European. The Basques have a long history of independence from larger powers, having defeated Charlemagne at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass and formed the Kingdom of Navarre. In the 20th century, some Basques fought to become independent from Spain by supporting the terrorist group ETA.\n\nThe Inuit peoples are indigenous to the Arctic portions of North America, particularly the Canadian territory of Nunavut. They are distinct from the First Nations and have a long history of contact with Europeans dating to the Viking settlement of Greenland. Inuit peoples traditionally lived through whaling and other forms of hunting. To survive in the harsh climate, they developed kayaks and parkas, while some Inuit people would seek shelter in igloos. The first full-length documentary, Nanook of the North, depicted a somewhat-accurate version of Inuit life in 1922. In the past, Inuit were known in English as “Eskimos”; that term is now considered offensive.\n\nThe Kurds are indigenous to Kurdistan, a mountainous region stretching between Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. For thousands of years, Kurds played a major role in Persian and Islamic civilization. During the Crusades, the Kurdish leader Saladin founded the Ayyubid Dynasty that ruled Egypt, Syria, and Arabia. After being denied their own country in the wake of the Ottoman Empire, many Kurdish people demanded independence. The Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, has fought a long conflict against the government of Turkey. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein committed genocide against the Kurds, who now control an autonomous Iraqi region defended by the Peshmerga military.\n\nThe Maori people are indigenous to New Zealand, which is known as Aotearoa in their language. The Maori are a Polynesian group who arrived as the first human settlers of New Zealand in the 1300s. In 1840 they signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which promised peaceful coexistence with new settlers from Britain. Despite later repression, Maori customs and culture remain a major part of life in New Zealand, exemplified by the traditional Maori haka dance performed by the country’s national rugby team. Many Maori practice ta moko, the art of tattooing.\n\nThe Maya people are indigenous to southern Mexico and Central America. They formed the ancient Mayan Civilization, which developed in the Yucatan peninsula. The Maya built cities like Tikal and Palenque, as well as the great pyramid of Chichen Itza, before declining in the ninth century. Today, most Mayan people live in Guatemala, where thousands were killed during a U.S.-backed genocide in the 1980s. For advocating on behalf of Mayan people, Rigoberta Menchú won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992.\n\nThe Quechua people are a collection of indigenous people in western South America, connected by speaking Quechua languages. They predominantly live around the Andes Mountains in Peru. Quechua people formed the Inca civilization, which emerged in the 1400s. The Inca built a system of roads that stretched thousands of miles and constructed cities like Machu Picchu. They were conquered by Spanish forces under Francisco Pizzaro in the early sixteenth century. Quechua people were the first to domesticate potatoes and inspired the English word “jerky.”\n\nThe Rapa Nui people are indigenous to Easter Island in the southern Pacific Ocean. The Rapa Nui are Polynesian and first settled on the island around 1200. They constructed massive stone figures known as Moai, which feature large elongated heads. The introduction of rats to Easter Island led to deforestation in the 18th century and a large decline in the Rapa Nui population. Today, about 10,000 Rapa Nui people live as citizens of Chile on Easter Island, with most residing in the town of Hanga Roa.\n\nThe Sami people are indigenous to northern Scandinavia. Because the harsh Arctic climate makes farming difficult, Sami people traditionally lived by herding reindeer and other animals. Following the Black Death, many Sami people migrated south to repopulate agricultural communities, but they faced persistent discrimination. However, many Sami retain traditional practices like joik, a style of folk singing which inspired the opening number of Disney’s Frozen. The Sami were traditionally known in English as “Lapps” or “Laplanders,” but those terms are now considered offensive."

    "title": "Geometric Curves",
    "content": "The circle is a curve consisting of the points that are an equal distance (called the radius) from a particular point (called the center). The irrational constant pi can be defined as the ratio of the circle’s circumference (the circle-specific term for perimeter) to its diameter (equal to twice the radius); the circle’s area is pi times the radius squared. A sector is the wedge-like shape bounded by two radii and an arc of the circumference; a chord is a straight line segment joining two points on the circumference. Cyclic shapes are shapes for which it is possible to draw a circle that goes through all the shape’s vertices; all triangles and all rectangles (including squares) are cyclic, but many quadrilaterals are not. The Cartesian equation (x−h)2 + (y−k)2 = r2 gives a circle of radius r centered at (h, k).\n\nThe circle is the simplest of the conic sections, which are the class of curves formed by the intersection of a plane with a double cone (two cones with the same axis, joined at the apex). Another definition of conic sections is that, for any point P on the curve, the distance from P to a point called the focus is equal to a constant multiple of the distance from P to a line called the directrix; the constant multiple is the eccentricity, a dimensionless number that describes how “squashed” the curve is or how far away it is from being a circle. For example, for a circle, the focus is the center, the directrix is a “line at infinity,” and the eccentricity is therefore zero. The next three entries are the other three conic sections, other than degenerate conic sections (a single point and various configurations of lines, are considered degenerate conics, meaning they can arise from mathematical definitions of conic sections but are not meaningful curves).\n\nEllipses are conic sections that resemble ovals. Their eccentricity is less than 1, and some definitions treat a circle as a special case of the ellipse. On an ellipse, the sum of the distances to two foci is constant. Their major axis and minor axis are the line segments within the ellipse that lie on their axes of symmetry, with the former being longer than the latter. In Cartesian coordinates, an ellipse has an equation of the form (x−h)2 + (y−k)2 = 1, where (h, k) is the center and a and b are the semimajor and semiminor axes (half the length of the major and minor axes, in either order depending on which is greater). The orbits of planets trace out ellipses, per Kepler’s first law.\n\nParabolas are conic sections that are open, meaning the curve does not “come back to meet itself.” They all have the same eccentricity, 1, meaning all parabolas are similar to one another and, for any point on the parabola, the distance to the directrix equals the distance to the single focus. The standard equation for an upward-opening parabola is x2 = 4 a y, with the focus being at (0, a). In Cartesian coordinates, the graph of any quadratic single-variable polynomial is a parabola. In a constant gravitational field, the path of a projectile is an arc of a parabola.\n\nHyperbolas are conic sections with eccentricity greater than 1. On a hyperbola, the difference of the distances to two foci is constant. Hyperbolas have two branches, each of which tends towards a pair of asymptotes. In Cartesian coordinates, an ellipse has an equation of the form (x−h)2 − (y−k)2 = 1, where (h, k) is the center.\n\nThe cycloid is the curve traced out by a point on the circumference of a circle as it rolls once along a straight line without slipping. Portions of a cycloid provide the solution to the brachistochrone problem, which is to identify the curve between two points so that a particle sliding frictionlessly down the curve will slide as fast as possible. The cycloid also provides the solution for the tautochrone problem, which seeks a curve for which the time taken for a particle to descend the curve does not depend on the initial position.\n\nThe catenary is the shape of a uniformly heavy chain (catena in Latin) suspended from two points at the same height in a constant gravitational field. The equations (in Cartesian coordinates) for catenaries use the hyperbolic cosine function. All catenaries are similar to each other. Though catenaries look similar to parabolas, y scales exponentially with x rather than quadratically as for the parabola.\n\nThe Witch of Agnesi is a bell-shaped curve given by the graph of y = 1 / (1 + x2). When rescaled, it becomes the probability density function for the Cauchy or Lorentzian distribution, which is well-defined but nevertheless has no well-defined mean. It was popularized by the mathematician Maria Agnesi, the first woman to receive a position as a math professor (though she apparently did not take it up). Its unusual name comes from a translator misreading its Italian name “versiera” as “avversiera,” meaning “witch.”\n\nThere are several types of spirals, all of which wind outwards from a central area and cross axes infinitely many times. One of the most familiar types of spirals is the Archimedean spiral, characterized in polar coordinates by its radius being a linear function of the polar angle (r = k θ). Other types include the logarithmic spiral, in which the radius is proportional to the exponential of a multiple of the polar angle (r = a ek θ), exemplified by the shell of the nautilus.\n\nThe cardioid, whose name references its heart-shaped appearance, can be defined similarly to the cycloid (see above) except that the circle now rolls around another identical circle. The cardioid has a cusp where the point on the former circle meets the latter circle. A cardioid generated from circles of radius a, and with its cusp at θ = 0, is given by the polar equation r = 2 a (1 − cos θ).\n\nThe lima¸on, whose name comes from a French term for “snail,” was described by Étienne Pascal, the father of Blaise Pascal. It is defined similarly to the cardioid, except that the point can now lie anywhere within the outer circle. Depending on their parameters, lima¸ons can have a cardioid-like “dimple” or an inner loop formed by the curve intersecting itself.\n\nLemniscates are a class of curves with a figure-8 shape. The infinity symbol is a lemniscate. There are several types of lemniscates, including the lemniscate of Booth, which is a special case of the hippopede, and the lemniscate of Bernoulli, along which the product of a point’s distances to two foci is constant. Its name comes from the Greek for “ribbon.”"

    "title": "Plagues And Pandemics",
    "content": "The Great Plague of Athens struck Greece in 430 BC, during the Peloponnesian War. According to the historian Thucydides, the disease spread to Athens from Ethiopia and killed up to 25% of the city’s population, including its leading statesman, Pericles. Though the illness spread to other cities, its particular impact on Athens helped Sparta become the foremost city in Greece. The cause of the plague remains unknown; historians have speculated that it may have been typhus or an unknown type of hemorrhagic fever.\n\nThe Antonine Plague spread across the Roman Empire from AD 165 to 180. Roman troops brought the disease into the Mediterranean world after returning from war against Parthia in Mesopotamia. The outbreak is named for the Antonine dynasty, which ruled Rome at the time under co-emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus (the latter of whom likely died of the plague); the dynasty’s founder, Antoninus Pius, had died in AD 161. The physician Galen wrote detailed accounts of the outbreak, which allowed modern scholars to determine that the plague was likely either smallpox or measles.\n\nThe Plague of Justinian is a common name for the first plague pandemic that swept Europe and Asia beginning during the 540s. The plague struck Constantinople during the reign of Justinian I, who was attempting to reassert Roman control over the Mediterranean. It was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the same agent that later caused the Black Death. The plague and its many recurrences devastated Byzantium and neighboring countries like the Sassanid Empire; their weakened states helped enable the Muslim conquests in the 7th century.\n\nThe Black Death is a common name for the second plague pandemic which spread in the mid-14th century. Mongol forces likely introduced the plague to Europe while besieging the Genoese colony of Kaffa in Crimea. Over the following decade, the disease killed roughly half of the continent’s population. It also sparked major social disruptions, including peasant revolts in England and France and mass anti-semitism, due to many blaming the plague on Jews. The frame story for Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron involves ten people fleeing the plague in Florence. Scattered plague outbreaks continued across Europe for the next 300 years, including the Great Plague of London in 1665. It is likely the deadliest pandemic ever.\n\nSyphilis, a sexually transmitted disease, spread across Europe beginning in the 1490s. While its origins are disputed, many Renaissance and contemporary scholars believe it came to Europe from the Americas after Christopher Columbus’s voyages. It was first described among French troops invading Naples in 1495 and known then as the “great pox.” Syphilis remained a major public health threat in the western world until the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s. In the 20th century, the U.S. government conducted a study in Tuskegee, Alabama that involved intentionally and inhumanely not treating hundreds of Black men infected with the disease.\n\nTyphus, an infectious fever carried by lice, spread across Europe in the late 1400s. While it may have been responsible for ancient pandemics, typhus was first conclusively identified among Spanish troops attacking Granada near the end of the Reconquista (15th century). Later typhus epidemics often coincided with military conflicts, for instance, causing most of the deaths during the Thirty Years’ War and Napoleon’s invasion of Russia. Typhus killed many victims of the Holocaust, including Anne Frank.\n\nSmallpox, a disease caused by the variola virus, circulated as early as 1500 BC. While the disease became endemic across Europe and Asia, it caused devastation when introduced to new populations. Smallpox came to the Americas through Spanish conquistadors, causing millions of deaths among indigenous civilizations like the Aztecs and Incas. Later colonial efforts caused the disease to reach and decimate Aboriginal Australians and other native peoples. Chinese doctors developed strategies for inoculating against smallpox in the 1500s, while Edward Jenner created the first ever vaccine to prevent it in 1796 using the similar cowpox virus. A successful 20th-century campaign by the World Health organization led to the eradication of smallpox in 1980.\n\nCholera is an intestinal infection that originated in India. Largely as a consequence of British colonialism, cholera swept the globe during six pandemics in the 19th century. In the U.S. the disease killed former president James Polk and caused many deaths along the Oregon Trail. While studying cholera in London, epidemiologist John Snow recognized the Broad Street pump as the common link in an outbreak and concluded that the disease was water-borne. Though now less fatal due to available treatments, cholera persists in large parts of the world; it killed over 10,000 people during a 2010s outbreak in Haiti.\n\nThe Spanish Flu pandemic killed up to 100 million people from 1918 to 1920. Caused by the H1N1 strain of influenza, the disease was first documented in a U.S. army camp in Kansas. It acquired its misleading name because Spain was one of the few countries not to censor information about it amid World War I, a conflict that drove the disease’s spread. Because Spanish flu often caused cytokine storms in its victims, it disproportionately affected younger people. Notable victims of the pandemic included Gustav Klimt and Max Weber.\n\nAIDS, a condition caused by HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus), triggered a pandemic beginning in 1981. Originating in monkeys, the virus jumped to humans in the early 20th century but did not spread widely until decades later. It is primarily sexually transmitted and devastated gay communities across the world in the 1980s and ’90s, largely due to intentional government inaction. The AIDS epidemic has also devastated sub-Saharan Africa; a 2013 study estimated that nearly 80% of all people currently living with HIV were from southern Africa. Gay journalist Randy Shilts chronicled the early pandemic and government indifference in his book And the Band Played On; he later died of AIDS himself. Public awareness of HIV/AIDS increased as it killed celebrities like Rock Hudson. The introduction of the drug AZT in 1987, later accompanied by other drugs, slowly helped reduce the disease’s mortality rate from nearly 100%. The pandemic spurred many works of art and literature, including the play Angels in America and the massive AIDS Memorial Quilt."

    "title": "Statements About Prime Numbers",
    "content": "The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes (its prime factorization), and that factorization is unique if the order of the factors is ignored. For example, 80 = 24·5, and there is no other way to express 80 as a product of primes other than changing the order (80 = 5·24 = 23·5·2, etc., but these are all really the same product). This includes prime numbers as a “product of just one prime,” e.g., 7’s prime factorization is just 7. This ubiquitous result in number theory is a principal reason that primes are so important.\n\nThere are infinitely many prime numbers. This is sometimes called Euclid’s theorem since Euclid’s Elements contained a proof of it similar to the following: Consider finitely many prime numbers p1, p2, … pn. Now consider 1 more than the product of those prime numbers, that is, p1p2×⋯×pn + 1. That number cannot be divisible by any of the original prime numbers pi. Therefore, it must itself be prime, or else be divisible by prime numbers that are not on the original list. Either way, that means there is at least one prime number not on the original list. That argument can be applied to any finite list of prime numbers, so there cannot be any finite list that contains every prime number. There are many other proofs of this statement.\n\nFermat’s little theorem (not to be confused with Fermat’s last theorem) states that if p is prime and a is any integer, then ap ≡ a mod p, that is, ap − a is divisible by p. This theorem is used in probabilistic primality testing, which is problematic because the converse is not always true: Carmichael numbers (of which 561 is the smallest example) are composite numbers n such that if a is any integer, an ≡ a mod n. Fermatଁs little theorem can be generalized to composite numbers as Euler’s theorem, which uses Euler’s totient function.\n\nWilson’s theorem states that p is prime if and only if (p − 1)! ≡ −1 mod p. Though named after the 18th-century English mathematician John Wilson, its first known use is by the 11th-century polymath Ibn Al-Haytham. A common proof of the theorem requires the useful fact that each number from 1 to p − 1 has a unique multiplicative inverse modulo p.\n\nThe Euclid–Euler theorem states that every even perfect number can be written in the form 2p − 1(2p − 1), where p is prime. The latter factor is a Mersenne prime (a prime number that is 1 less than a power of 2; the term Mersenne number refers to any number 1 less than a power of 2, regardless of whether it is prime), and the theorem also states that every Mersenne prime gives rise to a perfect number via that formula, meaning that this formula gives a bijection between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes. (The theorem says nothing about odd perfect numbers, but it is not known whether any odd perfect numbers even exist.)\n\nThe prime number theorem describes the approximate behavior of the prime counting function, π(n), which gives the number of primes less than or equal to n. There is no exact straightforward formula for this function, but there are several approximations, including this theorem. Specifically, the prime number theorem says that π(n) ～ n / logen, that is, as n becomes arbitrarily large, π(n) gets arbitrarily close to n / logen. There are many alternate formulations of this theorem, including in terms of the logarithmic integral.\n\nIt is very difficult to find prime factorizations of large numbers. This fact underlies public key cryptography algorithms like RSA (which, in turn, underlie much of the security in computing, such as safely transmitting credit card numbers for online payments) and many other algorithms in cryptography. Some cryptosystems use safe primes, which are primes that can be written in the form 2p + 1 for a smaller prime number p; these numbesr were first studied by Sophie Germain long before the advent of public key cryptography.\n\nGoldbach’s conjecture, sometimes called the strong Goldbach conjecture, is the unproven claim that every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. (For example, 16 = 5 + 11.) This has been verified from 4 to 4,000,000,000,000,000,000, but it has not been proven to be true for every even integer greater than 2. There are some interesting variations of this statement, such as that every odd integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three prime numbers, which is called the weak Goldbach conjecture and was proved by Harald Helfgott in 2013.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis is an unproven statement about the Riemann zeta function, ζ(s) = 1/1s + 1/2s + 1/3s +⋯, where s is a complex number. The hypothesis states that that function’s zeroes (roots) are all either negative even numbers or complex numbers whose real part is ½ (the latter called the critical strip or critical line). The Euler product is a technique that can be used to rewrite the zeta function as a product using prime numbers as indexes, which means the Riemann hypothesis has significant implications for how prime numbers are distributed, including for understanding how the approximation in the prime number theorem changes its accuracy (called the error term). The zeta function and hypothesis were introduced by Bernhard Riemann in 1859 in the paper “On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude.” Proving the hypothesis is a Millennium Prize Problem. It is generally believed to be true, and many results in advanced mathematics rest on an assumption that it is true, but it has not been proven.\n\nThe twin prime conjecture is the unproven statement that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by 2, such as 3 and 5, or 101 and 103. These pairs are called twin primes. There has been rapid progress recently on the related concept of prime gaps, which are the differences between consecutive primes (e.g., 31 and 37 have a prime gap of 6, while twin primes have a prime gap of 2); the twin prime conjecture is equivalent to stating that a prime gap of 2 occurs infinitely often. In 2013 Yitang Zhang showed that there are infinitely many prime gaps less than 70 million; over the next two years, James Maynard and the collaborative Polymath project reduced this bound to 4860, 600, and 246."

    "title": "People From The French Revolution",
    "content": "Louis XVI (1754–1793) was the king of France during the French Revolution. A member of the Bourbon dynasty, Louis inherited the crown during a financial crisis, which was exacerbated by France’s intervention in the American Revolution. After failed attempts at reform, Louis called the Estates-General, France’s long-dormant parliament, into session in 1789. When the Third Estate (consisting of everyone other than the clergy and nobility) declared itself the National Assembly and Parisian mobs stormed the Bastille, Louis reluctantly became a constitutional monarch. However, he resisted revolutionary policies and eventually tried—and failed—to flee France with his family in the Flight to Varennes. In 1792 he was deposed in the Insurrection of August 10; he was guillotined the next year.\n\nMarie Antoinette (1755–1793) was queen of France during the revolution. The daughter of Austrian empress Maria Theresa, she married the future Louis XVI to seal her mother’s alliance with France. Marie Antoinette’s Austrian background made her unpopular with the French people, and her standing worsened when she was wrongfully accused of not paying for jewelry during the Diamond Necklace Affair. A lavish spender, the queen was nicknamed “Madame Déficit” by those who blamed her for worsening the kingdom’s fiscal crisis. Marie Antoinette ardently opposed the revolution, and, like her husband, was guillotined in 1793.\n\nThe Comte de Mirabeau (1749–1791) was the preeminent figure in the National Assembly during the first years of the revolution. A scandal-plagued nobleman before 1789, Mirabeau rose to power through his oratory and close relationship with the royal family. He attempted to build a constitutional monarchy in France that resembled the government of Great Britain. After his death in 1791, the Panthéon was commissioned to hold his body and those of other great Frenchmen, though Mirabeau’s corpse was later removed when he was revealed to have received payments from the royal family.\n\nThe Marquis de Lafayette (1757–1834) was another leading liberal noble who helped launch the revolution. As a young man, Lafayette became famous fighting under George Washington in the American Revolution. He was an early leader in the National Assembly, becoming commander of France’s newly formed National Guard and drafting the Declaration of the Rights of Man with his friend Thomas Jefferson. Lafayette’s influence waned after the National Guard killed protesters during the Champ de Mars Massacre. He fled France in 1792 and was imprisoned by Austria. His exploits in the U.S. and France earned him the nickname “Hero of Two Worlds.”\n\nGeorges Danton (1759–1794) was a key leader of the Insurrection of August 10 that toppled the French monarchy in 1792. At the start of the revolution, Danton became a member of the Paris Commune that governed the capital, but soon emerged as a leader in more radical groups like the Jacobin Club and the Cordeliers Club. As foreign armies invaded France, Danton and his allies deposed Louis XVI with the support of the Parisian sans-culottes. Danton spearheaded the creation of the Committee of Public Safety—which effectively ruled France in 1793 and 1794—but after stepping back from politics, he and his allies were purged and guillotined in April 1794.\n\nMaximilian Robespierre (1758–1794) became the de facto leader of France during the Reign of Terror. Robespierre was a former lawyer from Arras who joined the Estates-General and, with Danton, led the left-wing Montagnard faction of the Jacobin Club. Robespierre supported a French republic, and his strict ideological and moral principles earned him the nickname “the Incorruptible.” In 1793 he rose to dominate the Committee of Public Safety and led its campaign to eliminate enemies of the revolution. He oversaw purges of the moderate Jacobin Girondins and the far-left Hébertists, as well as Danton and his allies. Robespierre also promoted a new deist faith he called the Cult of the Supreme Being. In July 1794 Robespierre was overthrown during the Thermidorian Reaction and was guillotined.\n\nJean-Paul Marat (1743–1793) was a radical newspaper publisher and proponent of revolutionary terror. A former scientist, Marat founded the Friend of the People newspaper in September 1789 and published incendiary articles calling for violence against those he saw as insufficiently committed to the revolution. To avoid arrest, Marat hid in Paris’s sewers, which gave him a debilitating skin condition, which he treated by taking long baths. In 1792 he supported the overthrow of the king and generated support for the September Massacres, in which mobs killed thousands of prisoners. In 1793 he was stabbed to death in his bathtub by Charlotte Corday; Jacques-Louis David depicted the scene in his painting The Death of Marat.\n\nCharles Maurice de Talleyrand (1754–1838) was the leading French diplomat of the revolutionary period. Talleyrand was a bishop when the revolution broke out and championed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which nationalized the Catholic Church in France. He later became foreign minister under the Directory, a five-man government that took power after Robespierre’s fall. Talleyrand’s demand to be bribed by U.S. diplomats sparked the XYZ Affair. In 1799 he helped Napoleon take power, but he eventually broke with the emperor and represented post-Napoleonic France at the Congress of Vienna in 1814.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821) became consul and emperor of France at the end of the revolution. Born to minor nobility in Corsica, Napoleon rose to fame in 1795 by defeating a Royalist uprising against the Directory with a “whiff of grapeshot.” He then led French armies to victory in Italy and led an expedition to conquer Egypt. In 1799 he overthrew the Directory in the Coup of 18 Brumaire and led France for the next 15 years. His seizure of power is often cited as the end of the French Revolution.\n\nLouis XVIII (1755–1824) was Louis XVI’s younger brother, whose return to power marked the definitive end of the revolutionary era. Louis XVIII, known as the Comte de Provence before the took the throne, led the émigrés who fled France during the revolution alongside his brother, the Comte d’Artois (later Charles X). After Louis XVI’s young son, the Dauphin, died in prison, Provence became the heir to the Bourbon line. When Allied forces defeated Napoleon in 1814, they restored Provence to the throne under the regnal name Louis XVIII. As king, Louis XVIII tried to roll back many elements of the revolution, with mixed success."

    "title": "Early-20th-century European Composers",
    "content": "Béla Bartók (1881–1945) is, after Franz Liszt, the most important composer from Hungary. Among Bartók’s best-known works is his Concerto for Orchestra (1944). Unlike what its title might suggest, the work does not feature a single soloist; rather, Bartók chose the name because of his virtuosic treatment of every orchestral family. Notable sections of the piece include its second movement, a “Game of Pairs.“ Bartók wrote six string quartets, which are arguably the most influential works in that genre after Beethoven’s. Bartók’s quartets contain many examples of his “night music,“ music that is intended to evoke quiet, moonlit natural scenes. Bartók’s opera Bluebeard’s Castle, based on a folk tale, follows a new bride as she opens a series of doors. In addition to his work as a composer, Bartók was a pioneer in the field of ethnomusicology, the study of folk music, and was among the first to use a phonograph to record folk music as performed by rural peoples.\n\nClaude Debussy (1862–1918) was a French composer who developed a modernist style of composition as a reaction against the work of Richard Wagner. Debussy is often described as an Impressionist composer, though he despised being labeled as such. Debussy’s Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun (1894) is an orchestral work that begins with a solo flute playing a descending and ascending partial chromatic scale; the work was later choreographed as a solo ballet by Vaslav Nijinsky. Debussy’s work often used non-traditional scales and harmonic progression—his two books of Preludes for solo piano include “Voiles“ (“Sails“), which utilizes the whole-tone scale; and “The Engulfed Cathedral,“ a musical depiction of the legend of Ys that features chords moving up and down in parallel planing, as opposed to traditional progression. Debussy’s only opera was 1902’s Pelléas et Mélisande, based on the play of the same name by Maurice Maeterlinck; rather than use a prepared libretto, Debussy set the text of the play as Maeterlinck originally wrote it.\n\nPaul Hindemith (1895–1965) was a German composer who moved to the United States to escape Nazi persecution. Hindemith’s music is often cited as an early example of new tonality—music that has a clear tonic pitch, but which does not follow traditional rules of harmony. Among Hindemith’s best-known works is his opera Mathis der Maler (Matthias the Painter), based on the life of the 16th-century artist Matthias Grünewald, who created the Isenheim Altarpiece. Much of Hindemith’s music fit into his ideal of Gebrauchsmusik, or “music for use“—works written for a specific purpose, time, or ensemble. During Hindemith’s time in America, he taught at Yale University, where his students included many of the most notable American composers of the later 20th century; his pedagogical texts are still used in the teaching of music today. Hindemith was a virtuoso violist, and premiered the solo part in his viola concerto Der Schwanendreher.\n\nGustav Mahler (1860–1911) is often cited as the most important symphonist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During his life, Mahler’s composing time was very limited—he was a renowned conductor, leading at various times the Vienna State Opera, as well as the New York Philharmonic and Metropolitan Opera. Mahler’s best known works are his nine completed symphonies; many of his early symphonies incorporate his settings of poems from Des Knaben Wunderhorn. His Fifth Symphony (1902) includes an oft-excerpted Adagietto for strings and harp generally considered a love song for his wife, Alma. Mahler’s Eighth Symphony, whose enormous performing forces led it to being nicknamed the “Symphony of a Thousand,“ sets both the hymn “Veni, Creator Spiritus“ and the concluding section of Goethe’s Faust. Mahler’s life was marked by tragedy, including the death of his daughter Maria and his discovery he had a heart defect that would eventually kill him; his Das Lied von der Erde (The Song of the Earth), a vocal symphony that sets translated Chinese poetry, was a major expression of his despair.\n\nSergei Rachmaninoff (1873–1943) was a Russian composer who moved to the United States following the Russian Revolution. Rachmaninoff, in addition to being a composer, was a virtuoso pianist, renowned for his massive hands that allowed him to play extremely wide chords. Rachmaninoff suffered a major setback early in his career when his First Symphony was criticized by Russian composer Cesar Cui as being a product of a “conservatory in Hell;“ Rachmaninoff subsequently fell into a deep depression and did not write for nearly three years, until intense hypnotherapy helped him overcome his demons and write his Second Piano Concerto. Rachmaninoff wrote a total of four piano concertos, which have become some of the most popular and oft-performed works in the entire genre. His Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, a concerto-like work for piano and orchestra, consists of a set of 24 variations on the 24th and final of composer Niccolò Paganini’s caprices for solo violin.\n\nMaurice Ravel (1875–1937) was a French composer who, along with Debussy, was commonly described as Impressionist; like Debussy, he hated being labeled as such. Ravel’s best-known work is Bolero (1928), an orchestral work based on a single repeating melody over a snare drum ostinato (a constantly-repeated rhythm), to which is gradually added more and more of the orchestra; Ravel conceived the work as an attempt to write “one very long, gradual crescendo.“ Ravel—like nearly all Europeans—was deeply affected by World War I; his 1917 piano suite Le tombeau de Couperin modernizes the form of a Baroque dance suite, and contains six movements that each memorialize a friend who died in the war. Ravel was a master of orchestration; his orchestral version of Modest Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition is still the version most commonly performed today.\n\nErik Satie (1866–1925) was a modernist French composer whose work is often cited as an early type of minimalism. His Gymnopédies, for solo piano, employ alternating chords that rarely change underneath a melody that floats above the repetitive harmony. Satie’s Gnossiennes—also for solo piano—were written without bar lines, implying a freedom from any regular sense of meter. Due to a note Satie left on his short keyboard fragment “Vexations”, the common modern performance practice is to repeat the fragment 840 times. Satie’s longer works include the ballet Parade, based on a scenario conceived by Jean Cocteau about a preview of a circus performance; the work also included a backdrop and cubist costumes designed by Pablo Picasso. Satie was a major influence on a young group of modernist French composers known as Les Six, who included Francis Poulenc and Darius Milhaud.\n\nArnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) was an Austrian composer instrumental in many of the most important developments in post-tonal music. Around 1910, Schoenberg began writing music that was atonal, meaning that it had no traditional tonic pitch. His 1912 work Pierrot lunaire utilized the technique of sprechstimme, a type of half-sung, half-spoken recitation on approximate pitch. In the early 1920s Scoenberg developed the twelve-tone method of composition, a technique in which each of the twelve chromatic pitches is ordered in a twelve-tone row, and each pitch is used before one is repeated; his first fully twelve-tone work was his Suite for Piano, opus 25, which he finished in 1923. The use of musical elements (including pitch) in a predetermined order would eventually become known as serialism. In addition to composing, Schoenberg was also an influential teacher: he and his students Alban Berg and Anton Webern are together known as the Second Viennese School.\n\nJean Sibelius (1865–1957) was a Finnish composer who often drew upon his homeland for inspiration. Sibelius’s best-known work is Finlandia, an intensely patriotic work written during Finland’s occupation by Russia, and which had to be presented under alternate titles due to censorship; the work’s final section, “Finland Awakes,“ is a hymn-like tune that has been adapted into many songs. Sibelius further drew on his homeland for his Lemminkäinen Suite, which is based on the Finnish folk epic the Kalevala; the suite’s movement “The Swan of Tuonela” is often performed as an excerpt. Sibelius was a prolific symphonist, writing seven works in the genre; his Seventh Symphony, in C major, is innovatively in only a single movement. Sibelius stopped composing during the last three decades of his life; he reportedly burned many of his works, including a draft of an Eighth Symphony that he never finished.\n\nIgor Stravinsky (1882–1971) was a Russian composer and one of the most towering figures in 20th-century music. Stravinsky’s output is generally divided into three main periods: his Russian period, his neoclassical period, and his serial period. Stravinsky was first catapulted to fame via three Russian period ballets he wrote for the Ballets Russe, headed by Serge Diaghilev, in the 1910s: The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911), and The Rite of Spring (1913), the latter of which caused a riot at its premiere due to the shocking modernistic aspects of the production. His neoclassical period (which lasted from about 1920 into the early 1950s) was sparked in part by his work on Pulcinella, a ballet (also commissioned by Diaghilev) based on older music (incorrectly) attributed to Giovanni Pergolesi. Stravinsky’s other major neoclassical works include his Symphony of Psalms and his “Dumbarton Oaks“ chamber concerto. In the 1950s, Stravinsky turned to serialism, though he used it less rigorously than many other composers. His major serial works include Agon, a plotless 1957 ballet choreographed by George Balanchine."

    "content": "Catan (1995, designed by Klaus Teuber) Originally entitled The Settlers of Catan, this game tasks players with settling an island of hexagonal tiles that each yield one of five resources: wheat, wool, brick, ore, and lumber. Each tile is marked with a number; players who have a settlement or a city on that tile gain its resource when its number is rolled on a pair of dice. Players race to a score of 10 points, which are gained by amassing special cards and expanding their settlements. No tiles are marked with a 7: a roll of 7 activates the Robber, who is moved to a tile to inactivate it while also forcing any player with more than 7 cards to discard half of them. Catan was the first international success for a “Euro-style” board game: a genre in which victory is achieved by attaining points through strategy and trade, rather than by eliminating other players through brute force or luck.\n\nCarcassonne (2000, designed by Klaus-Jürgen Wrede) Named for a historic French walled city, in Carcassonne, players draw and lay down tiles to create expansive fields, roads, cities, and cloisters. Newly laid tiles must be legally placed: for example, if the new tile has a road, it must be placed so that it connects to an existing road with an open end. Players gain points (each scored in different ways) by placing their limited Followers (in the form of small human-shaped tokens called meeples) when they lay down a tile. However, they cannot place a Follower on a feature that already has another player’s meeple on it. Followers in cities, on roads, and in cloisters are placed standing up, but meeples on fields are laid down, since they are scored only in endgame. Because many tiles introduce branches, dead ends, and finicky features, and the order in which they are introduced is random, each game of Carcassone is extremely different.\n\nTicket to Ride (2004, designed by Alan R. Moon) In the original Ticket to Ride, players place colored trains to create rail lines connecting cities across North America by drawing and playing cards of particular matching colors. At the beginning of the game, players draw secret cards listing various cities, and score points by linking those cities via their rail network—with more distant cities being worth more points. Points are also awarded to the player who creates the single longest rail route. Many localized editions have been made, including a version set in Europe, and the expansion USA 1910, which adds more destinations and more supplies.\n\nBetrayal at House on the Hill (2004, designed by Bruce Glassco) Betrayal at House on the Hill was lauded for combining both cooperative and combative gameplay using a wealth of classic horror genre tropes. A game of Betrayal is split into two phases. In the first phase, players cooperate and take turns moving their tokens to uncover new rooms in an old mansion; most rooms contain either a spooky Event, a helpful Item, or a strange Omen. When enough Omens have been found, the second phase—the Haunt—begins. One player (in the universe of the game) is revealed to have been a Traitor all along, at which point the Traitor has one objective (and consults a manual called the Traitor’s Tome) and the rest of the players band together to stop them (using the Secrets of Survival manual). In all editions, each Haunt (such as a ghost possession, vampire hunt, or demon summoning) is tied to an essentially random combination of elements, making Betrayal highly replayable.\n\nPandemic (2008, designed by Matt Leacock) Possibly the most popular cooperative board game, Pandemic centers on four viral diseases, with players coordinating their individual movements to minimize Outbreaks and find Cures. Starting in Atlanta (where the Centers for Disease Control is headquartered), players fly around the globe using their special powers (for instance, Scientists can find Cures faster; Medics can remove all of one disease during their turn, etc.). The game is challenging: players only win by eradicating all diseases, but can lose by running out of time in several ways. The acclaimed variant Pandemic Legacy (with editions Season 1, Season 2, and Season 0) uses the same mechanics but, as it is a legacy-style game, makes permanent changes to the board and cards depending on the outcome of each scenario.\n\nDominion (2008, designed by Donald X. Vaccarino) Dominion, set in the Middle Ages is the prototypical deck-building game, a genre in which each player begins with a set number of base cards that they must use to acquire more and more powerful cards that can increase the rate at which they gain money, allow them to perform more actions on their turn, let them hamper other players’ progress, or simply give them more points. The ultimate goal of Dominion is to earn victory points by purchasing Victory cards (usually lands), with larger lands (such as Provinces) being worth more; however, lands have a high cost, meaning that players must be able to draw enough Treasure cards during their turn to be able to afford them. Dominion became so popular that over 20 expansions of various sizes were created and released, each of which is interchangeable with the base game.\n\nCodenames (2015, designed by Vlaada Chvátil) In this party game, two opposing teams try to identify a secret array of “codenames” in a 5-by-5 grid of word cards. Only each team’s Spymaster knows which words are goals for their team. Much like the classic game show Password, each Spymaster gives one-word clues that they hope their team can associate with the target words. Correct guesses are marked with their team’s color, but if a team guesses wrong, they may inadvertently score a point for the opposing team (if that word is the codename of one of the enemy Agents). Some cards in each grid yield no points (Bystanders), but there is one word marked as the Assassin that yields an instant loss for the team guessing it.\n\nSecret Hitler (2016, designed by Max Temkin, Mike Boxleiter and Tommy Maranges) Secret Hitler is one of the most popular social deduction games—a genre in which players attempt to collaborate toward a goal, while a hidden faction of traitors secretly conspires to sabotage their efforts. Players are assigned a secret role at the beginning of the game: Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. The Fascists know who each other are, and who Hitler is; the Liberals do not. The game proceeds with the election of a president and chancellor and the passage of laws. The Liberals win by passing enough Liberal laws or identifying and executing Hitler; the Fascists win by passing enough Fascist laws, or by passing a smaller number of Fascist laws and getting Hitler elected chancellor. All actions in the game are up for discussion and vote, and lying is permitted. In a publicity campaign, the makers of the game sent a copy to every U.S. senator following the 2016 election.\n\nGloomhaven (2016, designed by Isaac Childres) A hardcore undertaking in both time and scope, Gloomhaven is often likened to Dungeons & Dragons without a Dungeon Master. Players control spellcasters and warriors in a fantasy setting, guided by thick rulebooks and scenario manuals dictating how to explore and play out scenarios. The game’s box is immense and contains countless cards, tokens, and maps, many of which are altered after each event—Gloomhaven is a legacy game, so its equipment and pieces are altered (or destroyed) based on the game’s outcome. It also has deck-building elements, since combat is based on a character’s ability cards, and well-timed worthwhile actions are key. Many campaigns of Gloomhaven go unfinished: each scenario can take over two hours to play, and a full game comprises dozens and dozens of scenarios and battles.\n\nAzul (2017, designed by Michael Kiesling) In Azul, players take turns amassing five types of tiles from a central factory area so they can build a beautiful 5-by-5 Portuguese-style mosaic. Because tiles of the same design cannot be put next to each other and because placing tiles is harder farther down on the mosaic grid, scoring and timing are rather complex. Azul’s key strategic component is in its endgame: Azul ends once a player completes just one row in their mosaic, meaning that a player in the lead may choose to end the game very early with a barely-done (but still highest-scoring) mosaic. Noted for being strategy-heavy yet easy-to-learn, Azul was also celebrated for the beauty and quality of its game pieces."

    "title": "French Directors",
    "content": "Georges Méliès (1861–1938), a professional magician, made some of the earliest narrative films and pioneered many filmmaking techniques, such as dissolves, multiple exposures, and the use of storyboards. He made several films inspired by the surreal voyages described in the works of Jules Verne, such as The Conquest of the Pole (1912), The Impossible Voyage (1904), and his most famous film, A Trip to the Moon (1902), which features an iconic shot of a cannon-propelled space capsule landing in the eye of the moon.\n\nAuguste (1862–1954) and Louis Lumière (1864–1948) invented a motion-picture camera and projector called the Cinématographe, from which the term “cinema” is derived. In 1895, the Lumière brothers shot the 46-second film Workers Leaving The Lumière Factory in Lyon and showed it as part of a paid public screening of ten films in December of that year, an event that is often regarded as the birth of cinema. According to a famous rumor, when the brothers publicly screened their film L’arrivée d’un train en gare de La Ciotat (1896), the sight of a train directly approaching the screen caused audience members to panic and run to the back of the room.\n\nJean Renoir (1894–1979), the son of the Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, had a career that spanned the silent film era to the early 1970s during which he worked in France, Hollywood, and India. Renoir’s films La Grande Illusion (1937), about a group of French officers during World War I plotting an escape from a German prisoner-of-war camp, and The Rules of the Game (1939), a satire about the French aristocracy on the cusp of World War II, are considered two of the best films ever made. When making his 1951 Technicolor drama The River in India, Renoir employed future director Satyajit Ray as a location scout.\n\nRobert Bresson (1901–1999) was known for his sparse and minimalist style, use of almost-exclusively non-professional actors, and the strong Catholic themes of his films. Bresson’s 1956 film A Man Escaped is influenced by his own experiences as a prisoner of war during World War II. Bresson’s 1959 film Pickpocket, a character study of a thief who believes himself to be above conventional morality, deeply influenced the works of Paul Schrader. Bresson also directed Au Hasard Balthazar (1966), which follows a donkey who is given to many cruel owners, and explicated his approach in a collection of aphorisms titled Notes on the Cinematograph.\n\nJacques Tati (1907–1982) was a mime who turned to film directing in the 1930s. In many of his films, Tati played a clumsy character named Monsieur Hulot, who had a characteristic stumbling walk and a recognizable overcoat and pipe. These films include Playtime (1967), which is set in a futuristic Paris, Mon Oncle (1958), a satire of the consumerism of postwar France, and Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday (1953), which is renowned for its visual gags.\n\nJean-Pierre Melville (1917–1973) was renowned for his films noir and gangster films, which include Le deuxième souffle (1966), Le Doulos (1962), Le Cercle rouge (1970), and Bob le flambeur (1956). The best-known of these films is Le Samouraï (1967), which stars Alain Delon as the professional hitman Jef Costello, who lives in a bare apartment with a small caged bird. Melville’s 1969 film Army of Shadows, which concerns the French Resistance during World War II, was unpopular upon release for casting Charles de Gaulle in a positive light; de Gaulle was particularly disliked at the time because of the May 68 political revolution of the prior year.\n\nAlain Resnais (1922–2014) belonged to the Left Bank of the French New Wave, a community that tended to produce more intellectual, literary films compared to the rest of the movement. Resnais was known for his experimentation with narrative forms and his close collaborations with literary authors. Novelist Marguerite Duras wrote the screenplay for Resnais’s 1959 film Hiroshima mon amour, which is about the romance between an unnamed Japanese architect and French actress, told in conversations between them intercut with brief flashbacks. Alain Robbe-Grillet supplied the screenplay to Resnais’s 1961 film Last Year at Marienbad, a disorienting film in which a man played by Giorgio Albertazzi attempts to remind a woman played by Delphine Seyrig of an affair they may have previously had. Resnais’s short 1956 documentary Night and Fog documents the horrors of Nazi death camps.\n\nAgnès Varda (1928–2019) was a Left Bank filmmaker whose debut film La Pointe Courte (1955) is often cited as the first film of the French New Wave. She is best known for her 1962 feature Cléo from 5 to 7, which follows a young singer in real time as she awaits the results of a test that will tell her if she has been diagnosed with cancer. Other major films by Varda include Vagabond (1985), a nonlinear drama examining the death of a drifter named Mona, Le bonheur (1965), about a man who finds happiness both in his marriage and in an extramarital affair, and Faces Places, a 2017 documentary in which Varda and the street artist/photographer JR travel around rural France and create portraits of the people they come across.\n\nJean-Luc Godard (1930–2022) was one of the pioneers of the French New Wave (La Nouvelle Vague) that revolutionized cinema as an art form in the late 1950s. His film Breathless featured a then-unconventional use of jump cuts, in which footage is removed from the middle of a continuous shot to communicate the passage of time. The film features Jean-Paul Belmondo as Michel, a criminal styling himself after Humphrey Bogart who is sheltered while on the run from the police by Patricia, played by Jean Seberg. In a string of 1960s films such as A Woman is a Woman, Vivre Sa Vie, Le Petit Soldat, Band of Outsiders, Alphaville, and Pierrot le Fou, Godard cast the actress Anna Karina, to whom he was married from 1961 to 1965. The year 1967, during which Godard’s films Two or Three Things I Know About Her, La Chinoise, and Week-End were released, marked the transition between his New Wave period and his more politically radical films of the next decade, some of which were made with the Dziga Vertov Group of Maoist filmmakers that he assembled. Godard continued to make films during the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, shooting the highly experimental 2014 film Goodbye to Language in 3D.\n\nJacques Demy (1931–1990) was known for his brilliantly colorful films with musical scores that took inspiration from Hollywood musicals and opera. His 1964 musical The Umbrellas of Cherbourg stars Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo as the young lovers Geneviève and Guy, who are separated when Guy is drafted to serve in the Algerian War. Deneuve returned to star in his 1967 film The Young Girls of Rochefort, which concerns the twin sisters Delphine and Solange, who move together from the title seaside town to Paris, where Solange is romanced by an American composer played by Gene Kelly. A 1993 documentary on the making of The Young Girls of Rochefort was directed by Agnes Varda, to whom Demy was married until his 1990 death from HIV/AIDS.\n\nFrançois Truffaut (1932–1984) was another co-founder of the French New Wave, making his mark on the movement with the 1959 film The 400 Blows. The film is about the juvenile delinquent Antoine Doinel, an alter-ego of sorts of Truffaut, who runs away from home and school, is arrested for stealing a typewriter from his stepfather, and escapes a juvenile detention center in order to see the ocean. Truffaut made four subsequent films continuing the story of Doinel: Antoine and Colette (1962), Stolen Kisses (1968), Bed and Board (1970), and Love on the Run (1979). In the influential French film magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, Truffaut articulated what became known as auteur theory, which likens the film director to an “author” who shapes every aspect of a film according to a personal vision. Jeanne Moreau starred as the woman at the center of a tragic love triangle in Truffaut’s film Jules and Jim (1962). Other major films by Truffaut include the gangster film Shoot the Piano Player (1960) and the metafictional Day for Night (1973) which won him the Best Foreign Film Oscar.\n\nClaire Denis (1946–present) is a contemporary filmmaker whose upbringing in France’s African colonies informed several of her films, such as her debut feature Chocolat (1988), White Material (2009), and her best-known film, Beau Travail (1999). Loosely based on Herman Melville’s novel Billy Budd, Beau Travail stars Denis Lavant as Galoup, Adjudant-Chef in the French Foreign Legion in Djibouti, who attempts to murder a fellow Légionnaire. Denis cast Robert Pattinson and Juliette Binoche in the 2018 film High Life, in which criminals serving death sentences are sent on a dangerous space mission. Her 2008 film 35 Shots of Rum is an homage to the Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu."

    "content": "Marcel Proust (1871–1922) wrote the seven-volume novel À la recherche du temps perdu, which has been translated as Remembrance of Things Past (by C. K. Scott Moncrieff, taking a phrase from William Shakespeare’s Sonnet 130) or as In Search of Lost Time (a more literal translation by D. J. Enright). The novel concerns the nature of involuntary memory, which is exemplified by an episode in the first volume, Swann’s Way (1913), in which the narrator’s recollections of his family’s home in Combray are triggered by eating a madeleine soaked in tea. Later volumes of the novel include In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower (1919), The Guermantes Way (1920–1921), Sodom and Gomorrah (1921–1922), The Captive (1923), The Fugitive (1925), and Time Regained (1927). Proust’s own homosexuality may have influenced the multiple same-sex relationships in the novel involving characters such as M. de Charlus, Albertine, and Odette.\n\nGertrude Stein (1874–1946) was American-born, raised in Oakland (about which she once quipped “there is no ‘there’ there”), but moved to Paris in 1903, where she established a salon at 27 Rue de Fleurus that was a meeting place for many of the leading modernist intellectuals. Her poetry often features very repetitive language, as exemplified by “Sacred Emily” (1913), which contains the line “rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.” Stein apocryphally told Ernest Hemingway “you are all a lost generation,” coining the name for the generation of Americans born in the last few decades of the 19th century. Stein recounted her life in Paris in The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (1933), written in the voice of her life partner.\n\nWallace Stevens (1879–1955) was an insurance executive by trade who wrote poetry in his spare time. His landmark collection Harmonium (1923) includes the poems “The Emperor of Ice-Cream” (which begins “call the roller of big cigars”), “Sunday Morning” (which notes that “Death is the mother of beauty”), and “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird” (whose first section reads “Among twenty snowy mountains / The only moving thing / Was the eye of the blackbird.”) His later poem “The Idea of Order at Key West” (1934) begins “She sang beyond the genius of the sea.”\n\nVirginia Woolf (1882–1941) honed the use of stream-of-consciousness as a literary technique to render the immediate thoughts and feelings of her characters. Her novel Mrs. Dalloway (1925) intertwines the narratives of Clarissa Dalloway’s preparations for hosting a party and the last days of the shell-shocked veteran Septimus Smith. She examined the obstacles facing women writers—such as a fictional sister of William Shakespeare, named Judith—in her 1929 essay “A Room of One’s Own.” Woolf’s work Orlando (1928), about an Elizabethan nobleman who lives for over 300 years without aging and who changes gender. was inspired by her lover Vita Sackville–West. Woolf was part of the Bloomsbury Group along with her husband Leonard. She died by suicide in 1941, drowning herself in the River Ouse.\n\nJames Joyce (1882–1941) wrote a modernist adaptation of Homer’s Odyssey set in his native Dublin, titled Ulysses (1922). The novel follows Leopold Bloom around the city on June 16, 1904 (a date that has since been annually celebrated as “Bloomsday” by fans of the novel). Leopold’s wife Molly is modeled after Joyce’s real wife, Nora Barnacle, and the novel also features Stephen Dedalus, the protagonist of Joyce’s bildungsroman and debut novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916). Joyce’s short story collection Dubliners (1914), which ends with the novella “The Dead,” depicts the citizens of the title city in their day-to-day lives. Joyce’s experimental novel Finnegans Wake (1939) opens with a sentence fragment beginning “riverrun, past Eve and Adam’s,” which is actually the conclusion of the book’s final sentence.\n\nD. H. Lawrence (1885–1930) wrote the novel Lady Chatterley’s Lover (1928), which was so sexually explicit and transgressive that an uncensored version was not published until 1960, when it prompted an obscenity trial against the publisher, Penguin Books. The novel concerns an affair between Constance Reid (Lady Chatterley)—whose husband Clifford is paralyzed by an injury during World War I—and her estate’s gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. Lawrence also wrote Sons and Lovers (1913), about the coal miner’s son Paul Morel, the sequential novels The Rainbow (1915) and Women in Love (1920) about the Brangwen family, and short stories such as “The Odour of Chrysanthemums” (1911) and “The Rocking Horse-Winner” (1926).\n\nEzra Pound (1885–1972) developed Imagism, a poetic movement that emphasized sharp language and clear, precise imagery—as exemplified by his poem “In a Station of the Metro” (1913), which reads in its entirety as follows: The apparition of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet, black bough. In his 1915 collection Cathay, Pound published very free-form translations of classical Chinese poetry, including Li Bai’s poem “A River Merchant’s Wife: A Letter.” Pound’s magnum opus was his epic poem The Cantos (1917–1962), which controversially contains expressions of Pound’s virulent anti-Semitism, fascist views, and admiration of Benito Mussolini; nonetheless, a section called The Pisan Cantos (1948) was awarded the inaugural Bollingen Prize. Pound edited and arranged for the publication of some of the most famous poems by his younger contemporary, T. S. Eliot.\n\nT. S. Eliot (1888–1965) wrote the influential modernist poem The Waste Land (1922), which he dedicated to Ezra Pound. The poem begins with the phrase “April is the cruellest [sic] month”; its numerous other quotable lines include “I will show you fear in a handful of dust,” and “These fragments I have shored against my ruins.” Eliot’s other famous poems include “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” (1915) which begins “Let us go then, you and I, / When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table”; “The Hollow Men” (1925), which ends “This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper”; “Ash Wednesday” (1930), about Eliot’s conversion to Anglicanism; and Four Quartets, consisting of “Burnt Norton,” (1936) “East Coker,” (1940) “The Dry Salvages,” (1941) and “Little Gidding” (1942). Eliot’s whimsical collection Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats (1939), which satirized many of his human friends, was adapted into Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Cats (1981).\n\nE. E. Cummings (1894–1962) is best known for eschewing standard capitalization and punctuation in his poetry. His poems include “anyone lived in a pretty how town” (1940), which describes how “anyone” was largely ignored and forgotten by the residents of the small town where he lived; and “i sing of Olaf glad and big” (1931), about a conscientious objector who is violently punished for his refusal to serve or display patriotism. Cummings’s own work as an ambulance driver in World War I, including his imprisonment in France for his pacifist views, inspired his only novel, The Enormous Room (1922). Cummings became a controversial figure for, in part, his use of racial slurs in some of his poems.\n\nHart Crane (1899–1932) is best known for his modernist epic poem The Bridge (1930), whose thematic centerpiece is Brooklyn Bridge (the explicit subject of the opening “Proem: To Brooklyn Bridge”); its other sections include “Ave Maria,” “Powhatan’s Daughter,” “The River,” “Cutty Sark,” and “Cape Hatteras.” The poem coined the phrase “Appalachian Spring,” which Martha Graham chose to title the 1944 ballet she choreographed to music by Aaron Copland. Other poems by Crane include “Voyages,” a sequence of erotic poems inspired by his love for the gay Danish sailor Emil Opffer and published in White Buildings (1926); and “The Broken Tower” (1932), written shortly before his suicide in the Gulf of Mexico."

    "content": "the sweat of your brow, from Genesis 3:19: “By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken.” Invoked to denote the rewards yielded by a person’s own hard work, this phrase is taken from the passages after Adam and Eve are banished from Eden for disobeying God, and must therefore find or produce food of their own rather than enjoy the fruits of the garden. Not only has this phrase has been used in extremely varied contexts, but it is also followed by another phrase that, in altered form, has become a common Judeo-Christian credo: “for dust you are, and to dust you will return,” which is typically shortened to “(from) dust to dust.”\n\nfire and brimstone, from Genesis 19:24: “Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven…” The phrase “fire and brimstone” often denotes highly traditionalist Christians, but can also, by extension, characterize any unwavering prediction of harsh justice and doom. Its passage of origin describes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the two “cities of the plain” whose residents were so sinful (Sodom is the etymological source of the word “sodomy”) that God rained brimstone (sulfur) and fire to obliterate them for mistreating Lot and his family. This phrase also appears in Revelation, which describes the “lake which burneth with fire and brimstone” where the souls of sinners die a “second death.”\n\na land of milk and honey, from Leviticus 20:24, among others: “But I said to you, ‘You will possess their land; I will give it to you as an inheritance, a land flowing with milk and honey.’ I am the Lord your God, who has set you apart from the nations.” Mentioned at least four times in the Old Testament, a “land flowing with milk and honey” is the homeland bestowed by God upon the Hebrews. It is the same place as “the promised land,” an epithet derived from the word “promise” in Deuteronomy 6:3 (which also uses the “milk and honey” descriptor), and is now used in common parlance to identify any land of plenty. The phrase first appears in Exodus 3:8 when Godin the form of the burning bush promises to lead Moses to a “land flowing with milk and honey.”\n\ngolden calf, from Exodus 32:2–4: “Aaron answered them, ‘Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons, and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.’ … He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’” Aaron is the older brother of Moses who, while Moses spends 40 days and 40 nights up on Mt. Sinai receiving the Ten Commandments from God, grows impatient and (against God’s will) forges a golden calf to worship; when Moses sees the idol, he throws down and shatters the commandment tablets. Today, a metaphorical “golden calf” is any object of desire or ambition that is regarded as immoral or ungenuinefor this reason, Charging Bull, the bronze statue of a bull in New York City that symbolizes Wall Street, is held up as both a literal and figurative golden calf by critics of capitalism.\n\nJezebel, from 1 Kings 16 (throughout) No one exact Biblical passage accounts for the modern usage of the term “Jezebel” to mean a brazenly promiscuous and devious woman; this usage derives from interpretation of her story as a whole. Jezebel, a pagan, married King Ahab and used her influence as queen to diminish worship of Yahweh in Israel, threaten the prophet Elijah, and help Ahab kill a vineyard owner. For these actions, Elijah prophesied Ahab’s death, as well as Jezebel’s (namely, that she would be eaten by dogs). Jezebel’s reputation as wanton seems to primarily derive from how, upon seeing Jehu (an enemy commander) marching on the palace, Jezebel put on make-up and jewelry to either taunt him, seduce him, or simply look regal. This was her final act; Jehu ordered eunuchs to push Jezebel from her window, where she fell into the street and had her flesh devoured by dogs.\n\nBehemoth, from Job 40:15–18: “Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you…. What strength it has in its loins, what power in the muscles of its belly! … Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like rods of iron.” Depending on translation, the monster Behemoth either was the first or the mightiest thing God created. Near the end of the Book of Job (which concerns a wager between God and Satan to see if God’s most righteous believer, Job, will lose his faith if deprived of all pleasure and comfort), Job begins cursing God. God appears as a storm and asserts that He alone created order out of chaos and that Job knows nothing. At the end a long speech about His power, God shows Job both Behemoth and the monster Leviathan to prove his ultimate power and wisdom. Behemoth, thus, has come to mean any unbeatable foe or gigantic entity.\n\nthe writing on the wall, from Daniel 5:5: “Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote.” Belshazzar was a king of Babylon whose sin and theft from Jerusalem’s First Temple doomed him. At a feast, the hand of God appeared and wrote out a blazing message on the wall. The prophet Daniel alone could read God’s message: Belshazzar’s soul was wicked, his death had been arranged, and his kingdom would be conquered. So rarely was God’s plan for a human made so public; “seeing the writing on the wall” has become an idiom for recognizing the obvious signs of an imminent outcome (especially a terrible one).\n\n(casting) pearls before swine, from Matthew 7:6: “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.” The “pearls before swine” analogy comes from Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount, where he exhorts his followers to preach his teachings, but to not waste time on those who do not welcome the message. A similar message appears later in Matthew in the form of another common idiom: Jesus advises followers “shake the dust from your feet” when leaving places where their preaching goes unheeded. Both phrases have lost their religious overtones in regular usage: “pearls before swine” identifies something valuable or beautiful that goes unappreciated, while “shaking the dust from your feet” often describes an ambitious person moving out of a small town.\n\nGood Samaritan (from Luke 10:30, “But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him; and when he saw him, he felt compassion.” The Good Samaritan appears in a namesake parable of Jesus about a Jewish traveler who is robbed, bloodied, and left on the road, where two travelers pass him by before a traveling Samaritan gives him generous, selfless aid. The emphasis in the parable is that the Samaritan is good despite Samaritans’ general hatred of Jews; the parable is created by Jesus to answer the question of who is truly a man’s neighbor, the implicit answer being every man. The directness of the parable has left its original sense wholly intact: today, a “Good Samaritan” is someone who stops to help, regardless of circumstance or inconvenience.\n\nye of little faith, from Matthew 6:30, “If God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?” Uttered in modern English in response to doubters and critics, this phrase occurs in the context of a passage known as “The Lilies of the Field” or “The Birds of the Air” in another section of Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount. To comfort those who worry about survival and day-to-day life, Jesus tells his followers, “Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.” Thus, Jesus claims that if a person devotes themself to God, they must trust that God will eventually reward and protect them. Today, the phrase is often used outside of any religious context, as a (sometimes sarcastic) rebuke."

    "title": "21st-century Quarterbacks",
    "content": "Peyton Manning played from 1998 to 2015 with the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos. Peyton is the son of Archie Manning, who spent the 1970s as the standout on an otherwise awful New Orleans Saints team, and the brother of Eli Manning, who won two Super Bowls as a New York Giants quarterback. After starring in college at Tennessee, Manning was drafted by the Colts, where he won four MVP awards and appeared in two Super Bowls, winning one. After early struggles in the playoffs, including two losses to rival Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, Manning finally defeated Brady en route to winning the Super Bowl in the 2006 postseason. In 2012, Manning moved to Denver, where he won one more MVP award and guided Denver to two more Super Bowl appearances, winning one in his last career game in 2015. Manning ended his career with a record number of MVP awards (5), still holds the single-season passing yards record, and was the only quarterback to lead multiple teams to multiple Super Bowls.\n\nTom Brady played from 2000 to 2022 with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brady was a lightly regarded prospect out of Michigan; the Patriots drafted him in the sixth round, after six other quarterbacks, and initially used him to back up Drew Bledsoe. In Brady’s second year, 2001, an injury to Bledsoe led to Brady starting and excelling, leading the Patriots to a surprising Super Bowl victory. Having locked down a starting job, Brady, the Patriots, and coach Bill Belichick would be playoff mainstays over the next 18 seasons, appearing in eight more Super Bowls and winning five of them, although their undefeated 2007 regular season ended in a Super Bowl loss. In 2020, Brady signed with Tampa Bay and immediately led Tampa to a championship during his first season there. After a brief, 40-day retirement in 2022, he played one more year in Tampa before retiring, apparently for good. He ended his career as the NFL leader in career passing yards and touchdown passes, and, in a nod to his remarkable durability, was the oldest MVP ever (at age 40 in 2017).\n\nDrew Brees played from 2001 to 2020 with the San Diego Chargers and New Orleans Saints. While Brees was very successful in college at Purdue, many teams questioned if he was too short to be a NFL quarterback (at 6′0″, Brees is several inches shorter than the average NFL quarterback). After a slow start in San Diego, Brees improved and posted strong 2004 and 2005 seasons before suffering a serious shoulder injury. Health concerns and a desire to start Philip Rivers led to the Chargers letting Brees go, and, in 2006, he signed with the Saints. There, alongside new coach Sean Payton, Brees immediately exceled, leading the historically weak Saints to unprecedented heights, including a Super Bowl victory in the 2009 postseason. Brees became an icon of New Orleans, a city rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina, and still lives there after his retirement. As a Saint, Brees set numerous records, including throwing at least one touchdown pass in 54 consecutive games and leading the NFL in passing yards in seven seasons; he remains second behind Tom Brady in career passing yards and touchdown passes.\n\nMichael Vick played from 2001 to 2015, mostly with the Atlanta Falcons and Philadelphia Eagles. After a standout college career at Virginia Tech, Vick was taken first in the 2001 NFL draft, becoming the first Black quarterback to be the number-one pick. During his career, especially in Atlanta, Vick’s ability to run as well as pass made him a devastating dual-threat quarterback. In 2006, he became the first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a season, setting a record since broken by Lamar Jackson. However, in 2007, Vick’s career took a significant downturn when he was arrested on charges of running an illegal dog-fighting ring. He spent 23 months in federal prison and never played another game for Atlanta. After getting out of prison in 2009, Vick faced a hostile public, but he was able to resurrect his career in Philadelphia, where he posted a dominant 2010 season, finishing second in the MVP vote. Vick retired in 2017 after brief stints with the Jets and Steelers. Vick’s efforts to atone after his release from prison included joining the Humane Society’s campaign to end dog fighting and successfully lobbying for a law that criminalized spectating, and bringing children to, illegal animal fights; he nevertheless remains a polarizing figure among NFL fans.\n\nPhilip Rivers played from 2004 to 2020 with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers and the Indianapolis Colts. After being drafted by the Giants and immediately being traded to the Chargers for Eli Manning, Rivers spent two years as the backup to Drew Brees before being named Chargers starter in 2006. He was immediately successful and established himself as a top performer. During his long tenure as the Chargers’ starting quarterback (2006–2019), the team only had four losing seasons. However, the team frequently stumbled in the playoffs, only reaching one conference championship game and never making the Super Bowl. Rivers remains the quarterback with the most career passing yards and touchdown passes to never play in a Super Bowl. As a starter, Rivers was also noted for his amazing durability. He started every game between 2006 and 2020, the second-longest streak for a quarterback in history, behind that of Brett Favre. After spending a final season as an Indianapolis Colt, Rivers retired in 2020.\n\nBen Roethlisberger played from 2004 to 2021 with the Pittsburgh Steelers. After a strong college career at the relatively small Miami University of Ohio, Roethlisberger was drafted by the Steelers. Unlike some rookies, he became the starter almost immediately. During regular season games Roethlisberger started in 2004, the Steelers went 13–0, a record for a rookie quarterback. His second year was even better: the Steelers won the Super Bowl, and Roethlisberger became the youngest Super Bowl-winning quarterback in history (at age 23). Roethlisberger became a fixture in Pittsburgh, leading the Steelers to many more successful years (during his tenure, the team never had a losing season), including one more Super Bowl win in two appearances. Roethlisberger became known as \"Big Ben,\" a reference to both his powerful arm and imposing frame. Roethlisberger was also dogged by controversy: in both 2009 and 2010, he was accused of sexual assault. While no criminal charges were filed, the scandals clouded Roethlisberger’s reputation until his 2021 retirement.\n\nAaron Rodgers was drafted out of California by the Green Bay Packers, where he initially backed up Brett Favre before taking over as the starter in 2008, upon which he immediately established himself as a top quarterback. In 2010, just his third year as full-time starter, Rodgers led the Packers to a Super Bowl victory. His tenure with Green Bay featured many playoff appearances and four MVP seasons. Rodgers has been noted for his accuracy and lack of interceptions—he has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history. However, the end of Rodgers’s Packers tenure was marked by playoff frustrations and controversies. After their 2010 championship season, the Packers never returned to the Super Bowl. During the COVID pandemic, Rodgers refused to be vaccinated and made several false statements about COVID. In April 2023, both sides moved on, as Rodgers approved a trade to the Jets to begin a new phase of his career; on just the fourth snap of his first game with the Jets, he tore his Achilles tendon, ruling him out for most if not all of the 2023 season.\n\nColin Kaepernick played from 2011 to 2016 with the San Francisco 49ers. After a successful college career at the University of Nevada, Kaepernick was drafted by the 49ers as a backup to Alex Smith. In 2012, when Smith was injured, Kaepernick replaced him and played well enough to remain as starter, guiding the 49ers through the playoffs and to the Super Bowl, where they lost to the Ravens (a game also notable for being the first Super Bowl to feature a pair of brothers, John and Jim Harbaugh, as opposing head coaches). While Kaepernick struggled in the 2015 season, his career would be forever altered in the 2016 season: during the preseason, Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem to protest police violence and support the Black Lives Matter movement, a decision that made him an intensely polarizing figure. After he and the 49ers parted ways at the end of the year, Kaepernick found no other teams interested in signing him. He accused the owners of colluding to drive him out of the league, and many believed he was being blackballed for the controversy. While Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since 2016, he remains an activist and still has occasionally tried out for teams.\n\nRussell Wilson has been playing since 2012 with the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos. Wilson had immediate success after Seattle drafted him: during his rookie year of 2012, he tied Peyton Manning’s rookie record by throwing for 26 touchdown passes; in that same year, he led the Seahawks to a last-second win when replacement officials controversially called a touchdown (rather than an interception) in a play later nicknamed the “Fail Mary.” In just his second year in Seattle, he led the Seahawks to a Super Bowl championship, the first in Seattle history and just the second Super Bowl win by a Black starting quarterback (the first was Doug Williams, who led Washington to a win in Super Bowl XXII in 1988). Wilson again led the Seahawks to the Super Bowl in 2014, but the team lost to the Patriots in the last few seconds when Wilson threw an interception near the end zone. He would continue to be successful in Seattle. Wilson’s final years in Seattle were chaotic; some of his teammates accused him of being selfish, and his relationship with coach Pete Carroll deteriorated. He was ultimately traded to Denver prior to the 2022 season. In 2022, Wilson was ineffective, and Denver posted the NFL’s worst scoring offense. Despite Wilson’s performance improving in 2023, the Broncos continue to draw significant criticism for trading so many resources for Wilson, then signing an expensive contract extension with him.\n\nPatrick Mahomes has played since 2017 for the Kansas City Chiefs. The son of former MLB pitcher Pat Mahomes, he spent one season as the backup to Alex Smith before being named starter in 2018. Mahomes immediately blew away expectations. In 2018, he led the Chiefs to the playoffs and was named MVP. The next year, he led the Chiefs to just their second Super Bowl win in franchise history, and became the third Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl. Mahomes has shown no signs of slowing down: in every year as starter, Mahomes has taken the Chiefs to at least the AFC Championship game, including two more Super Bowl appearances and one more win. Mahomes is also noted for leading spectacular comebacks, including a game-tying drive against the Bills with just 13 seconds left in the 2021 playoffs. In a 2019 game against the Bears, Mahomes taunted his opponents by counting to ten on his fingers, symbolizing how he had been the 10th overall pick in a draft in which the Bears selected quarterback Mitch Trubisky with the second overall pick."

    "title": "Accents And Dialects Of English",
    "content": "Received Pronunciation (or RP) is the “posh” or “proper” English accent heard in the urban southeast of England. Also called BBC English or sometimes “the Queen’s/King’s English,” it is associated with the middle-to-upper classes and esteemed schools such as Eton, Cambridge, and Oxford. RP is non-rhotic, meaning that /r/ sounds with no following vowel are almost never pronounced; thus, “car” is rendered close to “kah.” RP does not have the trap-bath merger, so vowels before certain consonants (f, th, and s especially) are lengthened; thus, “bad” in RP sounds nearly the same as General American “bad”; however, “bath” and “dance” sound like “bahth” and “dahnce.” It should be noted that RP, while heard widely on BBC news and in classrooms, is rare to hear in day-to-day interactions; 21st-century estimates indicate only 3% of British people default to RP in speaking.\n\nCockney refers to a specific dialect and accent that arose in East London among the lower classes; Eliza Dolittle (from George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion) is an iconic character who speaks Cockney. Like Received Pronunciation, it is non-rhotic with ending /r/ sounds being dropped. Its other iconic trait is H-dropping: when a breathy /h/ sound starts a word, that sound is dropped, thus rendering “hard” as something like “awd.” It also lengthens the vowel in the pronoun “I” (what linguists call the “price” vowel) to sound less like a homophone of General American “aye” and something like “oy.” In Cockney, a glottal stop replaces the /t/ in words like “bottle” and “matter” with a hitch or slight stoppage of sound, as heard in the middle of “uh-oh.” Cockney speakers also use a vocabulary derived from playful rhyming slang: an oft-cited example is the phrase “up the apples” to mean “upstairs,” which came from the fact that “upstairs” rhymes with “apples and pears,” and once “pears” is dropped, only “apples” remains. By the same process, “trouble” means “wife” (via “trouble and strife”). The rhyming half is not always dropped, especially with newer expressions (e.g., “Britney Spears” to mean “beers”).\n\nScottish English refers to the general English dialect spoken across Scotland; it is distinct from Scots or (Scottish) Gaelic, which are both distinct, separate languages. There are countless variants of Scottish English from locality to locality (Edinburgh being viewed as “standard” Scottish English, for example, and Highland as having a noticeable lilt), but a few rules hold fast. The most emblematic trait is the tapped /r/ sound. Scottish English is rhotic, meaning /r/ sounds are voiced even with no vowel afterward; thus, in the word “rhubarb,” both the first and second /r/ sounds are voiced, and are usually rendered by the tongue tapping the upper hard palate of the mouth just behind the teeth. This sound is so typical of Scottish that it is often called the “Scottish burr.” Another common Scottish sound—largely absent from most British accents—is the voiceless velar fricative: the throaty, raspy sound that is the /ch/ in the proper Scottish pronunciation of “loch” and in the exclamation “och aye.” Expressions common to Scottish English are the adjective “wee” for small and the renderings of “cannot/can’t” and “did not/didn’t” as “cannae” and “dinnae.”\n\nSouthern (American) refers to the general aspects of American English spoken across the Deep South (from Mississippi to South Carolina), and—to lesser extents—Florida, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, and Appalachia. One universal characteristic is the softening of the “price” vowel, as in the pronoun “I,” so that it is no longer a diphthong—resulting in a phrase like “I’m nice” sounding like “Ah’m nahss.” Southern accents also exhibit the pen-pin merger, in which “pen” and “pin” are effectively homophones; the same thing happens before /L/ sounds, so “fell” and “fill” are also often homophonic. Southern accents are non-rhotic, so /r/s with no following vowel are not pronounced—except, prominently, in the inland Florida Panhandle or Piney Woods Belt.\n\nUpper Midwestern, also sometimes called the Fargo accent or Minnesota accent (for its extreme prominence in the Coen brothers film Fargo), is found across the Upper Midwest in the Dakotas, Minnesota, northern Iowa, Wisconsin, and western Michigan. One of the most notable features of Upper Midwestern is the cot-caught merger (“cot” and “caught” becoming homophones), pronounced very far forward and very flat; another concerns words such as “flag” or “anger” in which the flat /a/ vowel before a /g/ or /ng/ becomes “ae,” such that “flag” rhymes with “plague.” In many areas, a plural /s/ is always rendered as a hard /s/;, even in a word such as “bars” where the /s/ typically produces a /z/ sound: thus, “bars” can rhyme with “sparse.” In general, the vowel sounds in “face” and “goat” are extremely flat (i.e., they are not diphthongs). The vowel in “yeah” can also resemble the German or Scandinavian “ja.”\n\nThe New York accent is dominant throughout the entire New York City metro area, including northern New Jersey and much of Long Island. In general, white New Yorkers exhibit a non-rhotic accent with heavy /th/-stopping—namely, in words like “that,” and “athlete,” /th/ becomes closer to /d/ or /t/, creating “dat” and “atlete.” Other traits include dropping the aspirated /h/ that begins the syllable “hue” (thus altering “huge” to “yooge”) and what is called “nurse” up-gliding (or the “coil-curl” merger), in which the “ur” sound in “nurse” veers towards “oy.” A rather unique trait of the New York accent is the nasal /ng/ sound, as in “wrong,” ending in a harder /g/ sound, as in the emblematic pronunciation of “Long Island” as “Long G’Island”—this last phenomenon is particularly common in the accent of the local Jewish community. In fact, the U.S.’s Ashkenazi Jewish population was so large and so concentrated in New York for so long that its local community’s accent and traits (such as a Yiddish-influenced lilt and the construction “you want I should” for “you want me to”) have remained common in Jewish communities across America long after dissemination outward from New York City. Linguists have struggled to verify the longstanding belief that accents vary from borough to borough, and so—functionally—a “Bronx accent” and “Long Island accent” are the same.\n\nAfrican-American Vernacular English (or AAVE) identifies the general dialect and accent among many Black American communities; it developed as a direct result of enslaved African communities learning English in the American South, and remaining forcibly segregated for centuries. Most slaves were from West Africa, and traits of that region’s languages influenced how enslaved Black people picked up English: notably, there is widespread /th/-dropping (turning “that” into “dat”) because few West African languages use the /th/ sound; there is also a reduction in consonant clusters at the end of words (turning “fifth” into “fif” or “chest” into “chess”), since clusters are also rare in West African languages. Dialectically, AAVE has a tense structure distinct from General American, particularly through its use of “done” and/or “been” as helping verbs, such as in “I done gone” to mean “I recently went”; the common dropping of forms of the verb “to be”; and its use of the word “ain’t” for negation.\n\nThe Transatlantic (or Mid-Atlantic) accent is often presented as a “fake” accent—one that radio, stage, and film performers were taught in the early 20th century to sound clear and refined, as the word Transatlantic itself evokes a hypothetical ideal accent “halfway” between American and English. While Transatlantic was often taught to actors, the idea that nobody naturally spoke it is incorrect. The Transatlantic accent overlaps strongly with an accent common among upper-crust Bostonians and other elite families in the Northeast, and its adoption elsewhere was due to Boston being the intellectual capital of America until the 20th century; non-actors such as Franklin Roosevelt and Gore Vidal inherited this accent naturally. Transatlantic shares many similarities with RP, in that it is non-rhotic, it has no trap-bath merger, and it has no Mary-merry-marry merger—those three words rhyme exactly in most American dialects, but not in Transatlantic and many other New England accents. Speakers of the Transatlantic accent in the affluent Hudson River Valley tend to speak it with restricted mouth movement, a posture that is sometimes nicknamed “Larchmont lockjaw” (as exhibited by critic William F. Buckley).\n\nThe Australian (or Aussie) accent has a comparatively limited number of variations given the size of the country in which it developed. This is due to both its rather recent settlement (English settlers first arrived in 1787), and its major cities and ports being in regular contact with each other for its entire history. Australian shares many traits with London English from the 18th century, which includes non-rhoticism but also no trap-bath split, so Aussie pronunciation of “trap” and “bath” have the same short /a/ vowel. Aussies also render the “price” vowel as closer to the General American “oy” than “eye.” Another vowel difference is the neutral “ih” sound, as in “fish,” being lengthening closer to “ee”—making “lick” nearly sound like “leak.” In recent years, the Aussie “oh” vowel (or “goat” vowel), as in “go slow,” has tended to end closer to the front of the mouth; the bunching motion that produces this sound has intensified among younger generations to the point where it can come very close to an /r/ sound, resulting in “no” sometimes sounding like “naur.”"

    "title": "New Testament Characters",
    "content": "The Virgin Mary is the mother of Jesus Christ. Mary was betrothed to Joseph; prior to their marriage, the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary to tell her she—a virgin—would conceive and give birth to the Messiah, in an event called the Annunciation. Mary’s song of praise after hearing this news is called the Magnificat. Mary and Joseph were forced to take shelter in a manger at Bethlehem, where she gave birth to Jesus. Following Christ’s birth, Mary only appears fleetingly in the gospels; she is mentioned as a witness to both Jesus turning water into wine at a wedding and to the crucifixion. The Roman Catholic Church considers Mary to be a blessed figure who intercedes for the church; the “Hail Mary” prayer is frequently performed by Catholics and several other Christian denominations. Mary, as the Madonna, is also commonly featured in religious artwork.\n\nJohn the Baptist prepares the way for the coming of Jesus. John was called the “Elijah who is to come” by Jesus, a reference to a great Old Testament prophet. The birth of John was also foretold by the angel Gabriel: John was the son of Elizabeth—a relative of the Virgin Mary—and the priest Zechariah, who was struck mute until John’s birth for doubting the news. As an adult, John was a “voice crying in the wilderness”—an eccentric who lived in the desert, ate locusts and honey, and predicted the coming of a man greater than himself. John baptized Jesus in the Jordan River, after which the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus. Legendarily, John was executed when Salome—who was promised anything she wanted after dancing for Herod—asked for John’s head on a platter, a scene depicted in many works of art, as well as an opera by Richard Strauss.\n\nPeter (also known as Simon and Simon Peter) is the foremost of Jesus’s apostles in the gospels. Peter and his brother Andrew (another disciple) were working as fishermen when Jesus called them to be “fishers of men.” Peter is depicted as an enthused, eager disciple who does not always completely understand things, as when he tries but eventually fails to walk on water, and when he is rebuked by Jesus for declaring that Jesus should not be executed. Despite these incidents, Jesus proclaimed Peter as “the rock” upon which the church would be built (“Peter” can be translated as “rock” in Aramaic). Peter, afraid of being arrested, denied knowing Jesus three times before a rooster crowed on the eve of the crucifixion. In Acts, Peter is present at the first Pentecost and raises a woman named Tabitha from the dead. Tradition holds that Peter died when he was crucified upside down. The Catholic Church holds Peter to be the first Bishop of Rome, or pope.\n\nJohn is a disciple of Christ and the attributed author of the fourth gospel. John is the brother of James, another disciple; some interpretations claim the two were blood relatives of Jesus. John and James were nicknamed the “Sons of Thunder” for requesting that Jesus call down fire on a town that rejected their message. The Gospel of John is the only non-synoptic gospel: it does not present a full account of the life of Jesus, but only focuses on specific aspects of his ministry, including miracles. John 3:16, one of the most quoted of all Bible verses, is usually translated as beginning “For God so loved the world.” John may have inserted himself into his own gospel as the so-called “beloved disciple,” an unnamed yet prominent figure (the “beloved disciple” is, for example, the only disciple at the crucifixion). Many traditions equate John the gospel author and disciple with John of Patmos, the attributed author of Revelation. John was reportedly the only disciple who was not martyred—he supposedly died of natural causes during the reign of Trajan.\n\nThomas is a disciple of Jesus who became known as “doubting” for disbelieving news of the resurrection. Thomas’s life before becoming a disciple is mostly unknown; he is occasionally referred to as “Didymus,” meaning “the twin.” The gospels only record Thomas speaking a few times prior to Jesus’s crucifixion. After Thomas hears that Jesus has risen from the dead, he proclaims that he will not believe such a thing has happened until he can see Christ himself and put his hands in Christ’s wounds. When Jesus later reveals himself to the gathered disciples, he offers Thomas the opportunity to touch the holes in his hands and side; after this, Jesus praises those who have not seen and touched what Thomas has, yet still believe. Tradition holds that Thomas brought the gospel to India, where he was martyred; some traditions claim that Thomas went even further east, to China and Indonesia.\n\nJudas Iscariot is the disciple who betrays Jesus to the authorities. Judas Iscariot is one of two disciples with that given name; the other Judas (also known as Jude or Thaddeus) is the son or brother of the disciple James. Judas Iscariot is believed to have been the treasurer for the disciples. During the Last Supper, Jesus identifies Judas as the one who will betray him; afterwards, Judas meets with the high priests and agrees to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. Judas identifies Jesus at the garden of Gethsemane by kissing him on the cheek, leading to Jesus’s arrest. Judas’s fate after betraying Christ is unclear—according to the gospels, he threw the silver away and hanged himself out of guilt; according to the Book of Acts, he used the money to buy a field, where he died when his guts burst open. Judas’s name has become a byword for “traitor”: in the Divine Comedy, he is one of the three men being chewed on by one of Satan’s three heads.\n\nMary Magdalene is a woman who becomes a follower of Jesus. The gospels claim that Jesus drove seven demons out of Mary Magdalene, after which she became a devoted follower, supporting him financially (leading to speculation that she was a woman of wealth). Several longstanding traditions conflate Mary Magdalene—possibly inaccurately—with Mary of Bethany, a sinful woman who repents and follows Jesus (and who is commonly depicted as a former prostitute). Thus, Mary Magdalene frequently appears in culture and art as the “penitent Magdalene.” The gospels claim Mary was a witness to the crucifixion, helped to bury Jesus, and was among the first to discover the empty tomb after the resurrection. Mary Magdalene is the subject of many conspiracy theories (popularized by novels such as The Da Vinci Code) claiming she was secretly Jesus’s wife.\n\nLazarus appears in the Gospel of John as the subject of one of Jesus’ most notable miracles. Lazarus—the brother of Martha and Mary of Bethany—is a friend of Jesus. Lazarus becomes ill, and his sisters send word to Jesus, who does not immediately travel to them; by the time Jesus arrives in Bethany, Lazarus has been dead for four days. Jesus’s reaction to the news of Lazarus’s death is, traditionally, the shortest verse in the King James Version of the Bible: “Jesus wept” (John 11:35). After grieving, Jesus goes to Lazarus’ tomb, tells those assembled they will see “the glory of God,” and commands Lazarus to come out, miraculously raising him from the dead. Aside from the Passion, the story of Lazarus being resurrected is the longest sustained narrative in John’s gospel, the culminating miracle of Jesus’ ministry, and a foreshadowing of his own resurrection.\n\nPontius Pilate is the Roman official who presides over Jesus’s trial and sentences him to death. Unlike many New Testament figures, Pilate’s existence is supported by a non-religious historical record: he was appointed Roman governor of Judea during the reign of Tiberius. In the gospels, after the high priests arrest Jesus, they take Jesus before Pilate, who is reluctant to do anything, especially after Pilate’s wife reports she had a dream warning Pilate not to get involved. In an oft-quoted verse, after Jesus claims to “testify to the truth,” Pilate asks “What is truth?”. Pilate tells the assembled crowd he can find no crime of which Jesus is guilty; he presents Jesus to the crowd with the phrase “Ecce homo,” (“Behold the man”) and has him flogged. After the crowd demands Jesus’s death—to the point of demanding that Pilate release the criminal Barabbas instead of Jesus—Pilate symbolically washes his hands and orders Jesus crucified.\n\nPaul is a prominent apostle who first appears in the Book of Acts and is the attributed author of 13 New Testament epistles. Paul—who was born Saul of Tarsus—was a very devout member of the Pharisees, a legalistic Jewish faction that opposed Christians. Paul’s first appearance depicts him giving tacit approval to the stoning of Stephen, one of the first Christian martyrs. Paul’s life changed while he was on the road to Damascus—he saw a vision of Jesus and was blinded; his blindness was later healed by an early Christian named Ananias. Paul subsequently traveled all over the Roman world and wrote letters to churches in Corinth, Galatia, and Ephesus; these letters became the New Testament’s Pauline epistles. Paul was eventually arrested in Jerusalem, put on trial, and sent to Rome, where tradition holds he was executed during the reign of Nero. Paul was joined on his second major journey by his companions Timothy and Silas, the former of whom is the title recipient of two epistles attributed to Paul."

    "title": "Non-western Classical Music Traditions",
    "content": "The gamelan is the traditional music ensemble of Indonesia’s Javanese, Sudanese, and Balinese peoples. A traditional gamelan ensemble mainly consists of percussion instruments, including gongs (horizontal, like bonang and kenong, or hanging, like kempul), xylophones (like saron and gambang), and double-headed drums (kendhang). Gamelan ensembles often play karawitan music to accompany ceremonies, dances, and wayang shadow puppetry performances. Gamelan pieces (known as gendhing) feature cyclic rhythmic patterns, a melodic framework known as a balungan, and are separated into gatras (the equivalent of measures or bars in western music). Gamelan music usually features the pentatonic slendro or heptatonic pélog scales. The gamelan piece “Puspawarna” was included on the Voyager Golden Record. Hearing gamelan music at the 1889 Paris Exposition inspired the later work of composer Claude Debussy.\n\nThe piphat ensemble of Thailand is comprised of xylophones called renat, a set of gongs called khong wong yai, quadruple-reed woodwinds known as pi (similar to an oboe), drums called taphon, and cymbals called ching. Written music is not used for a piphat performance; instead, the player of the khong wong yai plays a fundamental form of a melody, and the other instruments elaborate on that melody. Genres of works for the piphat ensemble include the phleng thao, which consists of three sections of increasing tempo. Piphat pieces are often inspired by nature, Buddhism, love, or other ethnic groups; the well-known pieces “Khaek Borathet” and “Khamen Sai Yok” are about Muslim travelers and a famous waterfall, respectively. The piphat is closely related to the Lao pinphat and Khmer pinpeat.\n\nThe classical music of India is generally subdivided into northern Hindustani music and southern Carnatic, which diverged around the 12th century due to Persian influence. Indian music is based on melodies known as ragas and rhythmic patterns known as talas. Pieces are anchored by a drone on the tonic (sa) and fifth (pa) of the ragas; today, many modern performers may employ an electronic drone box instead of having a live performer play the drone on a tanpura. Improvisational Hindustani genres include the austere dhrupad and the more elaborate khyal. Carnatic music concerts, known as kachheri, feature more structured pieces, such as varnams and kritis. In addition to a vocalist and a drummer on a tabla (Hindustani) or mridangam (Carnatic), performances may include stringed sitars and vinas, as well as reed flutes. Ravi Shankar was an influential Indian performer of the 20th century and inspired the Beatles to include Indian elements in many songs.\n\nThe music of China is less defined by genres and more defined by the instruments used in its performance. The guqin (known historically as just the qin) is a long, unfretted, seven-stringed plucked zither with a history stretching back thousands of years. Notable works for the guqin include “Gao Shan Liu Shui” (“High Mountain Flowing Water”), composed by Bo Ya during the Zhou dynasty; a recording of the work, as played by Guan Pinghu, was included on the Voyager Golden Record. Many guqin works have been adapted for other similar plucked string instruments, such as the guzheng. Other Chinese instruments include the dizi, a side-blown bamboo flute; the pipa, a four-stringed lute; and the erhu, a two-stringed bowed instrument. Many modern Chinese composers, including notable film score and concert composer Tan Dun, have paired traditional Chinese instruments with the classical Western orchestra in their works.\n\nThe music of Japan mostly features a pentatonic scale, known as yo, and emphasizes ma, the space between sounds. Gagaku is music of the historical Japanese court that was heavily influenced by Chinese practices; its instruments include a lute called the biwa, a double-reed woodwind called the hichiriki, the zither-like koto, and a 17-pipe mouth organ called the sho. The shamisen is a three-stringed, guitar-like instrument often used to accompany traditional kabuki theater in a style of music known as nagauta. The shakuhachi is an end-blown bamboo flute often associated with the meditative practices of Zen Buddhist monks. Japan’s percussive music includes the taiko drumming (known as wadaiko in Japan) using large, end-struck, double-headed, barrel-like drums; mythologically, taiko drumming is rooted in a story in which the sun goddess Amaterasu was lured out of hiding by loud dancing on an empty barrel.\n\nArabic traditional music is often subdivided into the music of the Middle East and the Andalusi music of North Africa and Muslim Spain. Music of the Middle East focuses on melodic modes called maqans and rhythmic patterns called iqa’at, which are split into measures called awzan. Much Middle Eastern music is performed by small takht, using instruments such as the oud (lute), qanun (zither), kamanja (a bowed string similar to a violin), and the darbuka (drum). Concerts of Arabic music feature sets of works called waslas, which may include pieces in the muwashshah genre, based on excerpts of classical Arabic poetry. Andalusi music includes works known as nubas, which include vocal and instrumental preludes and a main section known as a mizan. Andalusi instruments include the rebab, a bowed string instrument from the first millennium that may have influenced European viols and violins. Andalusi music also influenced the music of many Jewish communities of Spain and North Africa.\n\nTurkish classical music centers on the makam, derived from the Arabic maqam—modes or melodic systems defined by cesni (“flavor”) and seyir (“journeys”) of melodic development. A maqam is fitted to a rhythmic pattern called an usul, which incorporates tempo, meter, and style. Performances comprise secular vocal fasils, which include instrumental taksim and vocal gazel parts. Turkish music shares many instruments with the Arabic musical tradition, including the oud, qanun, rebab, and darbuka; it also features the bendir and def frame drums. Turkish notation and music theory was influenced by Europeans such as the Moldavian prince Dimitrie Cantemir and Giuseppe Donizetti, the brother of famed opera composer Gaetano Donizetti. Turkish mehterhâne ensembles inspired Western janissary bands and were referenced in certain works of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Turkey also has a folk tradition of bards called asiks, who sing epics called dastans accompanied by the baglama lute.\n\nPersian classical music, from Iran to Tajikistan, is also derived from Arabic music. In Iran, the radif repertoire comprises seven primary modes called dastgahs (akin to maqams) and uses fixed melodies called goshas. The goshas of a dastgah are connected to build a five-part suite with a pesh dar-amad prelude; rhythmic, virtuosic chaharmizrab; improvisational avaz; ballad-like tasnif; and rapid rang. Tasnif lyrics may draw from classical poetry or current events, such as the song “Morqe Sahar (“Bird of Morning”), which has been used to protest against both the early-20th-century shahs and Iran’s modern theocracy. Common instruments include the tar and setar lutes and santur dulcimer, all played by the blind musicologist Nur-Ali Borumand; the bowed kamancha, played by Grammy winner Kayhan Kalhor; the nay reed flute; and the tunbak drum. Iranian music developed into the Tajik and Uzbek shashmaqam (“six-mode”) tradition, with instruments like the tanbur lute, two-stringed dutar, and sata (an Uzbek setar). A shashmaqam piece is divided into the instrumental mushkilat and vocal nasr sections.\n\nThe jeliya music of the Mandé peoples of West Africa, has traditionally been played by jèli or griots, the musicians-historians-storytellers who formed an aristocratic caste that accompanied the kings of the Mali Empire. The Kuyate dynasty of griots descends from Bala Faseke, the griot of Sundiata Keita, the founder of the Mali Empire. Instruments include the bala, a gourd-resonated xylophone; the ngoni, similar to a banjo; and the kora, a 21-stringed “harp-lute” made famous in the West by virtuosos like the Malian Toumani Diabaté and Gambian Sona Jobarteh. Tonality and modality are more casual and relative in jèliya, and tuning is important but flexible; meter often consists of a repeating set of two phrases of beats, most commonly 4 + 4, and hemiola is common. The structure of jèlliya comprises vocal parts—the basic donkilo and recitative sataro melodies—and instrumental parts—the rapid, flighty birimitingo and the underlying kunbengo ostinato. Pieces are often improvisational and may employ call-and-response.\n\nThe mbira is a “thumb piano” central to the musical tradition of the Shona people of Zimbabwe. An mbira consists of over twenty metal tines fitted to a hardwood soundboard called a gwariva; the metal tines are plucked with the thumbs and forefingers to produce sound. A calabash, or fiberglass resonator known as a deze, may be used to amplify the instrument’s sound. Traditional mbira duets consist of a leading kushaura part and a following kutsinhira part, played as a call and response. Often, the kutsinhira is similar to the kushaura but a beat behind; the beat is kept with the rattling of the maraca-like hosho. The most common tuning for the mbira is Nyamaropa, which corresponds to the western Mixolydian mode. Mbira music has been popularized in the west by players like Dumisani Maraire and the chimurenga pop music of Thomas Mapfumo. Musicologist Hugh Tracey created a Westernized version of the mbira called the kalimba."

    "title": "Jazz Musicians",
    "content": "Miles Davis (1926–1991) was a trumpeter who developed or influenced the development of cool jazz, modal jazz, hard bop, electronic jazz, and jazz fusion over his long career. Davis’s 1959 modal jazz album Kind of Blue—which he recorded with the members of his First Great Quintet (which generally existed in the later 1950s), including John Coltrane—is widely considered to be the greatest jazz recording of all time. It includes the track “So What.” Davis’s Second Great Quintet (1960s) featured Herbie Hancock on piano and Wayne Shorter on sax and formed the core of the group that recorded Davis’s album In a Silent Way, which marked Davis’s first use of electric instruments and first venture into a more rock-and-roll fusion aesthetic. Davis’s early career was marked by his struggles with heroin addiction. His other notable albums include Sketches of Spain and Birth of the Cool.\n\nJohn Coltrane (1926–1967) was a saxophonist who was an influential figure in hard bop and modal jazz. Coltrane played saxophone on many other musicians’s landmark albums; for example, he was the tenor sax player on Miles Davis’s album Kind of Blue. His own major albums included Giant Steps, whose title track features chords that move down by major thirds (and which became known as the Coltrane changes) and a sax solo that led Coltrane’s playing to be described as “sheets of sound.” Coltrane’s quartet, which usually included pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones, produced the album My Favorite Things, whose title track is a cover of a song from The Sound of Music. Coltrane experienced a religious awakening while overcoming his addiction to heroin; his album A Love Supreme concludes with Coltrane “narrating” the words of a devotional poem via his sax playing. Following his death at age 40, Coltrane was named a saint of the African Orthodox Church.\n\nLouis Armstrong (1901–1971) was a renowned cornet and trumpet player, nicknamed “Satchmo” and “Pops.” Armstrong grew up in New Orleans and is among the best-known performers of the Dixieland style of jazz. Armstrong got early experience playing in bands led by Kid Ory and King Oliver before heading up his own group known as the “Hot Five,” whose members included both Kid Ory and Armstrong’s then-wife, pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong. The Hot Five’s recording of the track “Heebie Jeebies” features Armstrong’s scat singing, or singing using random, nonsense syllables. Armstrong was a renowned vocalist as well as instrumentalist, with his recordings of the songs “What a Wonderful World” and “Hello, Dolly!” His notable instrumental jazz compositions include “Potato Head Blues.”\n\nCharlie Parker (1920–1955) was an alto saxophone virtuoso who helped develop the jazz style known as bebop, which generally featured a fast tempo, rapid modulations, and thicker chords than the earlier swing style. Parker was nicknamed “Bird” or “Yardbird”; although the origins of this nickname are disputed, one popular tale involves Parker cooking and eating a chicken that had been hit by a bus. Parker referenced his nickname in the titles of many of his compositions, such as “Ornithology,” “Yardbird Suite,” and “Bird Gets the Worm.” Parker’s recording of his composition “Ko-Ko” features Miles Davis on trumpet; his composition “Blues for Alice” features a chord progression that heavily uses ii-V-I progressions and has become known as the Bird blues or the Bird changes. Parker died at the age of 34 following a long history of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nEdward Kennedy “Duke” Ellington (1899–1974) was a pianist and bandleader who wrote and recorded some of the most popular jazz standards of all time. Ellington often collaborated with arranger Billy Strayhorn, who wrote what would become Ellington’s signature tune, “Take the ‘A’ Train” (whose title refers to how to travel to Sugar Hill in Harlem). Ellington’s other compositions that became jazz standards include “It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing),” “Mood Indigo,” and “Prelude to a Kiss.” Ellington also performed and popularized works by his band’s members, such as trombonist Juan Tizol’s track “Caravan.” Ellington’s work as a composer extended beyond his own concert works: he wrote the score for the 1959 film Anatomy of a Murder.\n\nDave Brubeck (1920–2012) was a pianist whose lengthy career helped define the style of cool jazz. For most of his career, Brubeck led the eponymous Dave Brubeck Quartet; the quartet’s best known lineup, from the late 1950s through the 1960s, included Paul Desmond (sax), Eugene Wright (bass), and Joe Morello (drums). With this lineup, Brubeck’s quartet recorded the landmark 1959 album Time Out, which utilized non-traditional time signatures inspired by the folk music of Eastern Europe and Asia. The album’s best-known track is “Take Five,” a work in 5/4 time written by Paul Desmond. Brubeck continued to explore unusual time signatures on the follow-up albums Time Further Out (1961) and Time Changes (1964). Brubeck’s own notable compositions include “Blue Rondo a la Turk,” which subdivides measures of 9/8 time into a “2+2+2+3” grouping.\n\nBenny Goodman (1909–1986) was a clarinetist nicknamed the “King of Swing” for his association with the style. Goodman made more impact on jazz as a bandleader and performer of the works of others rather than as a composer himself; his orchestra’s signature tune was Louis Prima’s “Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing),” best-known from a 1937 recording featuring an extended drum solo by Gene Krupa. Goodman led his band in a landmark 1938 concert at New York’s Carnegie Hall, the first time a jazz band had ever played in the venue; the event was widely seen as “legitimizing” jazz as a genre. Goodman did not limit himself to performing only jazz music: he was the clarinet soloist at the premiere of Leonard Bernstein’s work Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs, and he commissioned Aaron Copland’s Clarinet Concerto.\n\nJohn Birks “Dizzy” Gillespie (1917–1993) was a trumpet player who was a leading figure in the development of bebop. Gillespie notably performed using a trumpet whose bell was bent upwards; according to Gillespie, his standard trumpet was damaged by someone falling on it in 1953, causing the bell to bend, and he liked the way it changed the instrument’s tone. He was also notable for performing with puffed-out cheeks. Gillespie’s composition “Salt Peanuts” features him yelling the title nonsense scat lyrics during the tune. Gillespie’s other bebop compositions that became jazz standards include “A Night in Tunisia” and “Groovin’ High.” Gillespie’s 1947 work “Manteca,” which he co-wrote with percussionist Chano Pozo, was a landmark in Afro-Cuban jazz, the first genre of jazz to integrate Latin rhythms and influences.\n\nCharles Mingus (1922–1979) is arguably the most influential player of the double bass in the history of jazz. Mingus’s compositions often feature sections of free improvisation, in which the musicians improvise without any planned chord changes or formal structure. His 1959 album Mingus Ah Um includes his work “Fables of Faubus,” a protest against Arkansas governor Orval Faubus’s resistance to school integration—though Columbia Records refused to allow the lyrics to be included on the album. Mingus’s other albums include The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, a single continuous piece originally conceived as a ballet. Near the end of his life, Mingus was diagnosed with ALS, which eventually left him unable to perform in the years before his death.\n\nBuddy Rich (1917–1987) was a drummer and big band leader renowned for his near-perfect playing technique. Rich did not read music; he learned completely by ear. Rich did not form his own big band until the mid-1960s; prior to this, he played drums for many of jazz’s other greats, including Count Basie, Charlie Parker, and Artie Shaw. Rich often engaged in “drum battles” with other jazz drummers, most notably Gene Krupa and Max Roach; he also appeared on an episode of the TV series The Muppets to engage in a drum battle with Animal. Rich’s recordings with his own big band include the 1968 album Mercy, Mercy (whose title is a reference to the Cannonball Adderley hit “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy”) and the 1975 album Big Band Machine, which included a version of the West Side Story melody that was one of Rich’s signature pieces."

    "title": "Works By Irish Authors",
    "content": "A Modest Proposal (1729) is a satirical essay by Jonathan Swift. In the essay, Swift proposes alleviating the “burden” created by the children of the poor by using the children as food. Swift cites a conversation with “a very knowing American” who notes that “a young healthy child, well nursed, is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food.” Swift continues this satire by offering advice involving the timing of availability (which would be greatest nine months after Lent), and notes that the flesh of children would be appropriate for landlords, since they “have already devoured most of the parents.” Swift couches his actual suggestions for alleviating poverty—such as taxing absentees—in a list of ideas he has considered and rejected as impossible to implement.\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) is the only novel by Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray is a handsome youth who has his portrait painted by his friend, the artist Basil Hallward. Under the influence of the hedonistic Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian pursues a life of sin and pleasure. However, as time passes and Dorian’s life grows more and more perverse—he causes the suicide of the actress Sibyl Vane and murders Basil—Dorian’s portrait becomes older and more disfigured and ugly, while Dorian himself remains eternally young and beautiful. At the end of the novel, Dorian stabs the portrait of himself; instantly, he dies and withers to a disfigured, decrepit corpse, while the picture returns to its original state.\n\nDracula (1897) is a novel by Bram Stoker that established many of the modern tropes regarding vampires. Dracula is an epistolary novel, meaning its narrative is conveyed through documents such as diaries and letters written by the characters. Jonathan Harker, a young solicitor (attorney), goes to Transylvania to meet Count Dracula, who wishes to purchase a house in London. Upon arriving in London, Dracula attacks and eventually kills Lucy Westenra, a friend of Harker’s fiancée Mina Murray. Dracula turns his attention to Mina; however, Abraham Van Helsing recognizes the danger posed by the vampire. Van Helsing, Harker, and several acquaintances pursue Dracula back to Transylvania, where they eventually kill him.\n\nThe Playboy of the Western World (1907) is a play by John Millington Synge. A young man named Christy Mahon enters a tavern in western Ireland, claiming that he is wanted for murdering his father. Christy’s tale, and the allure of his deeds, prompt the residents of the town—including Pegeen, the daughter of the tavern’s owner—to become infatuated with him. Eventually, Christy’s father shows up looking for him, revealing Christy’s story to have been a lie; Christy tries to maintain his image by attacking his father, but once again his father survives, and Christy leaves town with his father, much to Pegeen’s dismay. The play’s premiere at the Abbey Theater led to a riot caused by people who felt the play promoted a poor moral message.\n\nPygmalion (1913) is a play by George Bernard Shaw, titled for a mythical Greek sculptor who fell in love with a statue that came to life. Henry Higgins is a professor of phonetics; he makes a bet with his acquaintance Colonel Pickering that he could make other people mistake a flower girl—Eliza Doolittle—for a duchess simply by teaching her how to speak with proper diction and grammar. Higgins eventually wins the bet; however, Eliza has been so empowered by her education that she leaves Higgins, since she now longer needs him. Shaw vehemently opposed the numerous attempts by theater managers and movie producers to give the play a “happy ending” in which Higgins and Eliza fall in love and marry. Shaw’s play was the basis for the musical My Fair Lady.\n\n“Easter, 1916” (1916) is a poem written by William Butler Yeats in the aftermath of the Easter Rising, a week-long uprising against British rule in Ireland; the British government crushed the revolt and executed its leaders. The poem is in four stanzas, three of which end with the refrain “A terrible beauty is born.” In the poem, Yeats describes his past interactions with the revolutionaries, noting “I have met them at close of day” and “I have passed with a nod of the head / Or polite meaningless words” before stating “All changed, changed utterly.” In the last stanza, Yeats specifically memorializes the executed leaders “MacDonagh and MacBride / And Connolly and Pearse.”\n\n“The Second Coming” (1920) is a poem by William Butler Yeats that uses apocalyptic imagery to describe post-World War I Europe, which at the time was also gripped by a deadly flu pandemic. The poem opens by stating “Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold.” Yeats further notes “Surely some revelation is at hand; / Surely the Second Coming is at hand” and concludes the poem by asking “what rough beast, its hour come round at last, / Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?” Chinua Achebe used a line from Yeats’s poem to title his novel Things Fall Apart.\n\nUlysses (1922) is a novel by James Joyce that is often ranked as one of the greatest novels ever written. The majority of the novel chronicles a day in the life of Leopold Bloom; other principal characters in the work include Bloom’s wife Molly (who is having an affair with Blazes Boylan), Buck Mulligan, and Stephen Dedalus (the protagonist of Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and modeled on Joyce himself). Joyce largely based the structure of his tale on Homer’s Odyssey. The novel is noted for its use of a stream-of-consciousness technique, such as in the last line, when Molly Bloom thinks “yes I said yes I will Yes.” Ulysses takes place on June 16, 1904 in Dublin; fans of the novel have subsequently celebrated June 16 as “Bloomsday.”\n\nJuno and the Paycock (1924) is a play by Seán O’Casey, set during the Irish Civil War. Jack Boyle, who is known as “captain,” is the drunken head of a family that also includes his wife Juno, daughter Mary, and son Johnny. Charles Bentham brings news that one of Jack’s family members has died and has left him a large inheritance. Jack immediately begins to spend extravagantly; however, due to an error in the will, he discovers he will actually receive next to nothing, and all of his purchases are repossessed. Juno and Mary (the latter of whom has become pregnant due to an affair with Bentham) leave Jack, and Johnny is killed as a traitor by the IRA. The play is part of O’Casey’s Dublin Trilogy, which also includes The Shadow of a Gunman and The Plough and the Stars.\n\nWaiting for Godot (1953) is an absurdist play by Samuel Beckett, which Beckett described as a “tragicomedy” in a subtitle. Beckett, who was born in Ireland, lived much of his life in France; he originally wrote Waiting for Godot in French. Waiting for Godot is set on a roadside by a single tree. Two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, wait for the arrival of a man named Godot, who never actually appears—though in both acts, a boy does appear bearing a message from Godot that he will not come today, but will come tomorrow. While waiting, the two characters meet Pozzo and his slave, Lucky, who are passing by; Pozzo and Lucky also appear in the second act, but Pozzo has become blind and claims never to have met Vladimir and Estragon before."

    "title": "Arias",
    "content": "When I am laid in earth (also known as “Dido’s Lament”) is the final aria sung by the Carthaginian queen Dido in Act III of Henry Purcell’s opera Dido and Aeneas (1683). Dido, who has fallen in love with the Trojan prince Aeneas, is heartbroken when she learns that he is planning to leave because of what he believes in an order from Mercury. Dido sings this aria as she is dying of grief following Aeneas’s departure, after a recitative in which she asks for “Thy hand, Belinda” (her sister and handmaiden). In her aria, she urges “Remember me, but ah! Forget my fate.” The aria uses a chromatic “lament bass,” a common feature in Baroque opera involving a descent from tonic to dominant in a minor key, first introduced by Claudio Monteverdi.\n\nDer Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen (“Hell’s vengeance boils in my heart”) is an aria sung by the Queen of the Night in Act II of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s opera The Magic Flute (1791). The aria is commonly known as either just “Der Hölle Rache” or simply as “The Queen of the Night’s aria.” In the aria, the Queen of the Night gives her daughter, Pamina, a knife, and orders her to assassinate Sarastro; if Pamina does not kill Sarastro, the Queen will disown her. The aria is renowned as one of the most spectacular and most difficult soprano arias in the common repertoire; it requires the singer to not only hit several staccato high Cs in succession, but also for the singer to leap up to the F higher than that. Josepha Hofer, Mozart’s sister-in-law, played the Queen at the premiere of The Magic Flute; Mozart wrote “Der Hölle Rache” to showcase her high range.\n\nLargo al factotum (“Make way for the factotum [servant] of the city”) is an aria sung by Figaro in Act I of Gioacchino Rossini’s opera The Barber of Seville (1816). This is Figaro’s first major aria of the opera, and he sings it when he first appears on stage. In it, he describes himself as a “barber of quality,” notes that “everyone asks for me,” and describes himself as equally skilled with a “young lady” as he is with “razors and combs.” Figaro sings this as he is walking along the street; he is subsequently approached by Lindoro—really, Count Almaviva in disguise—who asks for Figaro’s help in wooing Rosina, the ward of the elderly Doctor Bartolo. In the oft-parodied, best-known moment of the aria, Figaro repeatedly sings his own name.\n\nIl dolce suono (“The Sweet Sound”) is an aria sung by Lucia in Act III of Gaetano Donizetti’s opera Lucia di Lammermoor (1835). In the opera (which is based on a novel by Sir Walter Scott), Lucia and Edgardo love one another; however, due to her brother Enrico’s machinations, Lucia is forced to marry Arturo instead. Lucia goes insane and stabs Arturo to death in the bridal chamber. In the aria—which is commonly referred to as Lucia’s “mad scene”—Lucia appears covered in Arturo’s blood, and hallucinates a scene in which she is marrying Edgardo. Donizetti maximized the eerie nature of the scene by calling for a glass harmonica in the accompaniment. “Il dolce suono” was a signature piece for soprano Joan Sutherland.\n\nLa donna è mobile (“Woman is fickle”) is sung by the Duke of Mantua in Act III of Giuseppe Verdi’s opera Rigoletto (1851). The aria is a canzone (literally, a song), with verses and a repeating refrain that compares a woman to a “feather in the wind.” In Rigoletto, the title hunchbacked court jester swears revenge on the Duke of Mantua after the duke seduces Rigoletto’s daughter, Gilda. Rigoletto pays the assassin Sparafucile to kill the duke; however, Gilda—in love with the duke—offers herself to die in the duke’s place. The Duke first sings “La donna è mobile” after arriving at Sparafucile’s house (having been lured by the promise of sex with Sparafucile’s sister). Later, as Rigoletto is dragging the sack with what he thinks is the Duke’s dead body, he hears the Duke again singing “La donna è mobile.” His daughter—not the duke—is in the sack.\n\nL’amour est un oiseau rebelle (“Love is a Rebellious Bird”) is an aria from Act I of Georges Bizet’s opera Carmen (1875); it is sung by the title character the first time she appears on stage. The aria is in the style of an habanera, a dance developed in Cuba (and whose name refers to the city of Havana), and is often simply known by the name of the dance. Bizet adapted the aria’s music from a piece by composer Sebastián Iradier, thinking it was a traditional folk melody rather than an original work. In the aria, Carmen sings that “love is a rebellious bird that no one can tame” to a seductive, chromatically-descending melody, proclaiming “if you don’t love me, then I love you” and “if I love you, be on your guard.” At the end of the aria, Carmen throws a flower to Don José, who subsequently falls in love with her and eventually kills her.\n\nVesti la giubba (“Put on the Costume” or “On with the Mottley”) is sung by Canio at the end of Act I of Ruggero Leoncavallo’s opera Pagliacci (1892). Canio and his wife Nedda are members of a commedia dell’arte performing troupe; Canio’s role is that of Pierrot (the clown), while Nedda’s role is that of Colombina, Pierrot’s unfaithful wife. At the end of Act I, Canio has discovered that Nedda has been unfaithful in reality; however, they have a performance scheduled, so Canio is faced with the torture of having to dress up as Pierrot and play out humorously, on stage, what is actually happening in his real life. In the aria’s signature moment, Canio sings “Laugh, clown, at your broken love!” Enrico Caruso’s 1902 recording of the aria became the first record to sell more than one million copies.\n\nNessun Dorma (“None Shall Sleep”) is an aria sung by Prince Calaf at the beginning of Act III in Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot (1926). The Chinese princess Turandot swears she will only wed any man who can answer her three riddles; she executes any who fail. The disguised Prince Calaf correctly answers Turandot’s riddles and poses one of his own: if she can learn his name by sunrise, then she can still execute him. Calaf sings “Nessun Dorma” as all of Turandot’s subjects frantically try to discover his name. In the aria, Calaf claims he will only speak his name on the princess’s mouth, when he kisses her. The aria ends with three triumphant cries of “Vincerò,” or “I will win!” The aria was the signature performance piece of tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who also performed it in concert as part of the “Three Tenors” supergroup.\n\nSummertime is an aria sung by Clara at the beginning of Act I in George Gershwin’s opera Porgy and Bess (1935). “Summertime,” which is the first significant number in the opera, is sung by Clara as a lullaby to her baby. A languid, undulating harmony accompanies Clara, as she sings “Summertime and the livin’ is easy / fish are jumpin’, and the cotton is high.” Clara and her husband Jake die in a hurricane at the end of Act II; in Act III, Bess reprises “Summertime” by singing it to their baby, who is now an orphan. Gershwin wrote “Summertime” in an attempt to capture the feel of a Black spiritual; the piece subsequently became a jazz standard. The lyrics for “Summertime” were written by DuBose Heyward, who also wrote the novel on which the opera is based.\n\nNews has a kind of mystery is sung by Richard Nixon in Act I of John Adams’s opera Nixon in China (1987). The “News” aria is Nixon’s first significant aria, sung after the Spirit of ’76 touches down, he exits the plane, and greets Zhou Enlai (stylized as Chou En-lai in the opera’s libretto). Nixon marvels at the instantaneous nature of the moment, and of news in general, singing that “when I shook hands with Chou En-lai on this bare field outside Peking, just now, the world was listening.” As Chou introduces various officials, Nixon continues to sing about the news, noting “It’s prime time in the U.S.A., yesterday night” and that the meeting is being broadcast on all three major U.S. networks. The aria features Adams’s signature minimalist style; Nixon at first repeatedly sings the word “news,” then repeats the phrase “has a” several times before singing the full sentence."

    "title": "Greek Heroes",
    "content": "Heracles (or, as the Romans referred to him, Hercules) is often considered the greatest of the Greek heroes. He was the son of Alcmene and Zeus, which earned him the lifelong enmity of Zeus’s wife Hera. Hera struck Heracles with a temporary madness so that he killed his wife Megara and their children. As penance, Heracles served King Eurystheus for ten years and completed twelve labors. Some of his most famous labors were slaying the Nemean Lion, whose skin was impenetrable; slaying the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra, which would sprout new heads when one was cut off; redirecting two rivers to clean the massive Augean stables in one day; and capturing Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog of the Underworld. Heracles was killed when the centaur Nessus tricked Heracles’s wife Deianira into giving him a poisoned shirt. After his death, Heracles was deified and married the goddess of youth, Hebe.\n\nTheseus was a prince of Athens who was described as both the son of King Aegeus and the son of Poseidon. He was raised by his mother Aethra in Troezen, then as a young man took a land journey back to Athens, during which he defeated six foes, including the bandits Sinis, Sciron, and Procrustes. After Theseus was sent by Medea to kill the Marathonian Bull, he voluntarily went to Crete to combat the Minotaur, a bull-headed monster who devoured the Athenian tributes demanded every nine years by King Minos. Minos’s daughter Ariadne gave Theseus a ball of string to help him navigate the Labyrinth, and he successfully slew the Minotaur. Theseus escaped with Ariadne, but later abandoned her on the island of Naxos. On the way back to Athens, Theseus forgot to replace the black sails on his ship with white sails, which led his father King Aegeus to commit suicide because he believed Theseus had been killed.\n\nPerseus was the son of Danaë and Zeus. Perseus’s grandfather, King Acrisius of Argos, had heard a prophecy that his grandson would kill him, so he banished Danaë and Perseus by setting them adrift in a chest on the ocean. Perseus grew up on Seriphos, whose king Polydectes resolved to marry Danaë unless Perseus could bring him the head of the gorgon Medusa, a monstrous woman with snakes for hair and a petrifying gaze. After securing advice from three sisters called the Graeae, Perseus located Medusa, and using Hermes’s winged sandals, Hades’s Helm of Invisibility, and a mirrored shield from Athena, he was able to behead her. On his way back to Seriphos, Perseus used the head of Medusa to rescue the Ethiopian princess Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus. Perseus also killed Polydectes, whose advances on Danaë had turned violent in his absence. During an athletic competition later in life, Perseus accidentally hit the spectating Acrisius with a discus, killing him and thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nJason was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos who had been usurped by Jason’s uncle Pelias. In an attempt to kill Jason, Pelias offered him the throne if he completed a quest to Colchis and retrieved the Golden Fleece. Jason assembled a crew of heroes, named the Argonauts after their ship, the Argo, for the quest. When they arrived in Colchis, King Aeëtes agreed to give Jason the Fleece if he performed a series of daring tasks. With the help of Aeëtes’s daughter, the sorceress Medea, Jason yoked the fire-breathing Bulls of Colchis, plowed a field and sowed it with dragon’s teeth, defeated the Spartoi warriors that sprung from the teeth, and finally overcame the dragon guarding the fleece. When Jason and Medea returned to Iolcos, they murdered Pelias and were exiled to Corinth. Jason abandoned Medea for the Corinthian princess Glauce, and in revenge, Medea killed Glauce as well as her own children with Jason. For breaking his marriage vow, Jason lost favor with Hera and died unhappy.\n\nAchilles was the greatest Greek warrior during the Trojan War. He was the son of King Peleus and the Nereid Thetis, who dipped him in the River Styx as a child to make his body invulnerable, except for the heel by which she held him. Thetis tried to keep Achilles out of the Trojan War by disguising him as a girl on the island of Skyros, but his trickery was exposed by Odysseus. Achilles refused to continue fighting in the Trojan War after the Greek commander, Agamemnon, seized his concubine Briseis. As the Trojans start to gain the upper hand, Achilles’s friend (and, by many interpretations, lover) Patroclus donned Achilles’s armor and led his Myrmidon warriors into battle. After Patroclus was killed by the Trojans’ best warrior, Hector, Achilles flew into a berserk rage and massacred many of the remaining Trojans, including Hector. Achilles was eventually killed by the Trojan prince Paris, who shot an arrow into Achilles’s vulnerable heel.\n\nOdysseus was a king of Ithaca and one of the Greek leaders during the Trojan War. Odysseus originally tried to avoid the war by pretending to be insane, but was exposed when Palamedes put his son Telemachus in front of his plow. During the war, Odysseus showcased his cunning by proposing the idea for the Trojan Horse. Odysseus’s ten-year journey home from the war is the subject of Homer’s Odyssey. He escaped and blinded the cyclops Polyphemus, foiled the enchantments of the sorceress Circe, was forced to live with the sea nymph Calypso for seven years, and much more. When Odysseus arrived back in Ithaca, he found that his loyal wife Penelope was being harassed by rowdy suitors who believed him to be dead. Odysseus disguised himself as a beggar, and when Penelope proposed an archery contest among the suitors, he revealed his identity and killed them. After Odysseus convinces Penelope that he truly is her husband, they happily reunite.\n\nDiomedes was a king of Argos and a great Greek warrior, second only to Achilles in martial prowess during the Trojan War. Early in life, Diomedes’s father Tydeus, who was a member of the Seven Against Thebes, was killed during a rebellion against the city. Diomedes and the other Epigoni (the sons of the Seven) avenged their fathers by sacking and plundering Thebes. During the Trojan War, Diomedes and Odysseus participated in a daring night raid on the Trojan camp. One Trojan warrior named Glaucus challenged Diomedes to single combat, but after they realized that their grandfathers had been friends, they swapped armor instead of fighting. Diomedes was the only mortal other than Heracles to fight and injure gods, wounding both Ares and Aphrodite. After the war, Diomedes founded many cities in Italy.\n\nAjax the Great, or Telamonian Ajax, was a massive and powerful Greek warrior during the Trojan War. Ajax fought with a massive shield made of cow-hide and bronze, which he used to protect his half-brother Teucer, a potent archer. Ajax fought the premier Trojan warrior, Hector, and wounded him, but the match was called a draw and Ajax gave Hector a purple sash in exchange for Hector’s sword. Ajax competed with Odysseus for the armor of Achilles after his death, but the armor was awarded to Odysseus. In a fit of rage and insanity, Ajax slaughtered a herd of sheep, thinking they were the Greek leaders who had ruled against him. When Ajax came to his senses and realized what he had done, he committed suicide in shame.\n\nBellerophon was a demigod son of Poseidon. He rejected the advances of Queen Stheneboea, who then falsely accused him of assault. King Iobates refused to directly murder a guest, so he instead sent Bellerophon on a perilous quest to defeat the Chimera, a fire-breathing monster with the head of a lion, body of a goat, and tail of a snake. To aid in his quest, Athena visited Bellerophon in a dream and gave him a golden bridle with which he tamed the flying horse Pegasus. Bellerophon rode Pegasus up to the lair of the Chimera and threw a spear tipped with a block of lead into its mouth; the monster’s breath melted the lead, which suffocated it. Bellerophon’s arrogance, or hubris, grew so much that he attempted to ride Pegasus up to Mount Olympus and live among the gods. Zeus sent a gadfly to sting Pegasus, and Bellerophon fell and was blinded from his landing. He lived the rest of his life wandering the land in misery.\n\nAtalanta was abandoned on a mountain as a baby because her father wanted a son. She was raised by bears, which helped her become one of the greatest and fastest hunters. Atalanta joined the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, a giant wild boar that was ravaging the land. Atalanta drew first blood on the boar, and after it was killed, the leader of the hunt, Meleager, awarded its hide to her. After the hunt, Atlanta was recognized by her father, who wanted to arrange a marriage for her. A prophecy had foretold Atalanta’s doom if she married, so she agreed to only marry the man who could beat her in a race; all losers were killed. One suitor, Melanion, enlisted the help of Aphrodite, who gave him three golden apples which he used to distract Atalanta during the race and win the contest and her hand in marriage. After Atalanta and Melanion had sex in a temple of Zeus, the gods turned them into lions as punishment for their disrespect."

    "title": "Geologic Time Periods",
    "content": "The Hadean Eon (4600 million years ago to 4000 mya) stretches from the formation of the Earth to the formation of the oldest known rocks. The Hadean is so named because of its harsh conditions, such as intense leftover heat from planetary accretion, the absence of a stable atmosphere, and the frequency of impacts. Key events during the Hadean include the Moon’s formation (4500 mya), likely due to the impact of a small planet with the young Earth, and liquid water ocean formation (4400 mya).\n\nDuring the Archean Eon (4000 to 2500 mya), the Earth cooled enough for stable continents to form. There is contrasting evidence as to whether a period of increased impact events called the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB, 4100 to 3900 mya) during the early Archean actually occurred. The Archean Eon also saw the emergence of life, the first definitive evidence of which comes from stromatolites—fossilized microbial mats that formed in shallow coastal areas.\n\nThe Proterozoic Eon (2500 mya to 541 mya) contained the Great Oxidation Event (GOE, 2400 to 2000 mya), during which oxygen levels rose significantly due to oxygenic photosynthesis performed by cyanobacteria. During the late Proterozoic, the Earth underwent multiple glaciation events, possibly even resulting in a fully frozen “Snowball Earth.” The last period of the Proterozoic Eon was the Ediacaran Period, during which the first known multicellular organisms with specialized tissues—mostly simple, sessile, and flat marine animals—evolved. The Proterozoic was followed by the Phanerozoic Eon—the current eon, characterized by the abundance of plant and animal life.\n\nThe Cambrian Period (541 mya to 485 mya) is the first period of the Phanerozoic Eon and Paleozoic Era. The key event of the time period was the Cambrian Explosion, during which almost all modern animal phyla appeared. The Cambrian Explosion is an example of adaptive radiation, an event by which organisms rapidly evolve and diversify to take advantage of new resources or fill empty ecological niches. The cause of the Cambrian Explosion is unknown, but could be due to environmental changes or evolutionary breakthroughs such as eyes and/or animals that were exclusively predators. Evidence for the Cambrian explosion can be found in the Burgess Shale, a fossil deposit in British Columbia. This period also contained the Cambrian Substrate Revolution, in which the evolution of burrowing animals allowed water and oxygen to penetrate deep into ocean sediments and permanently alter their chemistry.\n\nThe Ordovician Period (485 mya to 444 mya) contained the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event. Invertebrates flourished, with marine filter-feeders dominating the shallow seas of the period. The Ordovician saw the first complex life on land, as plants colonized the continents. The end of this period was marked by the Ordovician Mass Extinction, the second largest mass extinction in Earth’s history, which killed around 85% of marine species. The mass extinction is thought to have been caused by the Late Ordovician glaciation, which caused sea levels to fall and eliminated many of the shallow seas that housed most organisms of the time.\n\nThe Silurian Period (444 mya to 419 mya) was much more stable and warm than the Ordovician. The Silurian saw the expansion of terrestrial life. Vascular plants—which have specialized tissues containing lignin for transporting water and minerals—emerged, as well as terrestrial fungi and three groups of terrestrial arthropods: myriapods (centipedes and millipedes), arachnids (spiders), and hexapods (insects). Jaws and bones evolved for the first time in fish, which were beginning to rapidly diversify.\n\nThe Devonian Period (419 mya to 359 mya) is sometimes known as the Age of Fishes, as they came to dominate marine environments. Some fish even moved beyond the ocean; during the Devonian, the ancestors of four-limbed vertebrates, or tetrapods, began to adapt to life on land as the first amphibians. Land plants also underwent an adaptive radiation sometimes known as the Devonian Explosion, as evolutionary innovations including the first leaves, roots, and seeds allowed them to rapidly colonize swaths of dry land. These plants may have also indirectly caused the Late Devonian Mass Extinction by absorbing huge quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide, leading to global cooling and marine anoxia (low-oxygen conditions). The extinction primarily affected marine organisms; at least 75% of species went extinct, including almost all of the formerly dominant trilobites.\n\nThe Carboniferous Period (359 mya to 299 mya) can be divided into two halves: the Mississippian (359 mya to 331 mya), and the Pennsylvanian (331 mya to 299 mya). The Carboniferous is named for the abundant coal deposits dated to that time. Receding seas led to the prevalence of lowland swamps, which were filled with lignin-rich trees and numerous ferns. These extensive forests sequestered carbon dioxide, leading to an increase in atmospheric oxygen levels to about 35%, as compared to 21% today. High oxygen levels may have led to gigantism in insects; millipedes grew to over 8 feet long and dragonflies had wingspans of 30 inches. The Carboniferous is also known as the Age of Amphibians, as tetrapods became the dominant terrestrial animals and began to diversify. The first amniotes appeared, as well as the first reptiles. Landmasses including the southern continent Gondwana and the northern continent Laurasia collided to form the supercontinent Pangaea, which was surrounded by the Panthalassic Ocean.\n\nThe Permian Period (299 mya to 252 mya) saw a decline of the swamps of and rainforests that dominated the Carboniferous and an increase in deserts throughout the interior of Pangaea. Amniotes were able to cope with the prevalent dry climates, and two amniotic groups—the synapsids (ancestors of modern mammals) and sauropsids (reptiles)—greatly diversified. The end of the Permian was marked by the Permian Mass Extinction (also known as the Great Dying), the largest mass extinction in Earth’s history; over 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct. The extinction is thought to have been caused by an eruption of the Siberian Traps, a large igneous province that released massive amounts of lava and noxious gasses. The outgassing of carbon dioxide led to severe global warming, ocean acidification, and anoxia. All large synapsids went extinct, leaving an ecological void.\n\nThe Triassic Period (252 mya to 201 mya) was the first period of the Mesozoic Era. A specialized group of reptiles called archosaurs underwent adaptive radiation to fill the voids left by the Permian Mass Extinction. The dominant group of archosaurs was the pseudosuchians, ancestors of modern crocodiles. Another group of archosaurs, the dinosaurs, first appeared, as well as the first true mammals. The climate of the Triassic was hot and dry, but became humid as Pangaea began to break up near the end of the period. The period ended with the Triassic Mass Extinction, which wiped out about 75% of species. Marine invertebrates were hit particularly hard, but large pseudosuchians and amphibians also went extinct, paving the way for the rise of the dinosaurs.\n\nThe Jurassic Period (201 mya to 145 mya) was the first to be dominated by dinosaurs. The climate was warm; there were no ice caps and forests stretched to the poles. Many of the most well-known dinosaurs from the Jurassic Period are known from the Morrison Formation in Colorado, including Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, Brontosaurus, Diplodocus, and Apatosaurus. Archaeopteryx, a transitional species between dinosaurs and birds, was discovered in the Jurassic-age Solnhofen Limestone in Germany. The skies were ruled by flying reptiles called pterosaurs, and the oceans were dominated by marine reptiles, including ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs.\n\nThe Cretaceous Period (145 mya to 66 mya) was similar to the Jurassic. The climate was still warm, with numerous shallow inland seas. Dinosaurs continued to dominate, and mammals and birds continued to diversify. Angiosperms, or flowering plants, appeared for the first time and quickly became the dominant group of plants on Earth. North America was split lengthwise by the Western Interior Seaway, which was dominated by marine reptiles called mosasaurs. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs that walked the land included Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor, and Triceratops. The Cretaceous Period, and the Mesozoic Era, ended with the Cretaceous-Paleogene Mass Extinction. A worldwide layer of iridium dated to 66 mya sparked the Álvarez Hypothesis, which posited that the extinction was caused by a huge impact event. This idea was strongly supported by the discovery of the massive Chicxulub crater on the Yucatán peninsula. 75% of all species went extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs and large terrestrial animals.\n\nThe Cenozoic Era (66 mya to present) is the current era, sometimes known as the Age of Mammals. During the initial Paleogene Period (66 mya to 23 mya), mammals diversified and grew in size to become the dominant land animals, filling the void left by the previous mass extinction. Temperatures were high at the beginning of the period, peaking at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), but cooled down during the Oligocene epoch as Antarctica froze. During the Neogene Period (23 mya to 2.6 mya), landmasses settled close to their modern positions. The current period is the Quaternary Period (2.6 mya to present). The period’s Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 mya to 11,700 ya) was marked by cyclical ice ages. It saw the evolution of megafauna including mammoths, saber-tooth tigers, and giant sloths and armadillos, as well as the first appearance of Homo sapiens. The current epoch is the Holocene epoch, which is characterized by the growth and impacts of the human species."

    "title": "Supreme Court Cases Involving Lgbt+ Rights",
    "content": "ONE, Inc. v. Olesen (1958) was the first Supreme Court case to deal with LGBT rights. In January 1953, an early group of gay activists in Los Angeles began publishing ONE, the first magazine aimed at the gay and lesbian community. Otto Olesen, the postmaster of L.A., refused to mail out the October 1964 issue, claiming that its content was obscene and thus prohibited from being mailed under the 1873 Comstock Act. In a 1958 ruling, the Supreme Court cited its previous precedent in Roth v. U.S. (which concerned what constitutes obscenity), effectively ruling that material is not per se obscene just because it contains LGBT content. The case was not argued before the Court; the ruling was instead issued as an unsigned, short per curiam decision reversing the Ninth Circuit. ONE magazine continued to be published until late 1969, shortly after the Stonewall riots.\n\nBowers v. Hardwick (1986) upheld the constitutionality of state laws outlawing sodomy or other types of homosexual intercourse. In 1982, an Atlanta police officer gained access to Michael Hardwick’s apartment to serve an invalid warrant for public drinking; he observed Hardwick and another man engaged in consensual sex, and arrested both for sodomy. Although the DA declined to prosecute him, Hardwick challenged the state’s sodomy law in court. Although the Eleventh Circuit found Georgia’s sodomy law unconstitutional, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, upheld the law’s constitutionality. In the Court’s majority opinion, Byron White wrote that laws against sodomy did pass the “rational basis” test of government interest, and that the right to privacy did not cover homosexual behavior. During deliberations of the case, Justice Lewis Powell switched his vote from upholding the Eleventh Circuit to overturning it; he later publicly regretted the case’s outcome.\n\nRomer v. Evans (1996) held that a state constitutional amendment denying LGBT persons status as a “protected class” was unconstitutional. In 1992 Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution holding that anyone of “homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation” could not “have or claim any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination.” Robert Evans, a gay man, sued to prevent the amendment’s enforcement. The Colorado Supreme Court struck down the amendment as failing to meet “strict scrutiny.” The Supreme Court upheld the Colorado court’s ruling, but noted that the measure did not even pass the “rational basis” test; the Court’s 6–3 majority opinion noted the amendment “identifies persons by a single trait and then denies them protection across the board,” calling it “unprecedented in our jurisprudence.” Romer was the first of several major LGBT rights opinions written by Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nBoy Scouts of America v. Dale (2000) held that a private organization was allowed, under the First Amendment, to exclude LGBT persons from membership. James Dale was an Eagle Scout who later became an Assistant Scoutmaster; after he came out as gay in a newspaper interview, he was removed from his leadership post and ousted from the Scouts, as the Boy Scouts had a policy prohibiting gay members and leaders. Dale sued the Scouts, arguing that New Jersey’s law prohibiting discrimination against gay people in public accommodations prevented the Scouts from removing him for his sexuality. Although Dale won his case before the New Jersey Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state ruling, holding in a 5–4 majority opinion that the First Amendment’s freedom of association meant that private groups were permitted to exclude persons whose presence would “derogate from the organization’s expressive message.” In 2014, the Boy Scouts lifted its ban on gay members; one year later, it lifted its ban on gay leaders.\n\nLawrence v. Texas (2003) declared laws against sodomy to be unconstitutional. In 1998 police entered the apartment of John Lawrence in response to a false report of a Black man with a gun; they arrested Lawrence and Tyron Garner for violating Texas’s sodomy law. Writing for a 6–3 majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy stated that “The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.” in holding that the Due Process Clause prohibited government “intervention” in their conduct. The Court also explicitly addressed its previous decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, noting “Bowers was not correct when it was decided, is not correct today, and is hereby overruled.” Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who voted with the majorities in both Bowers and Lawrence, filed a concurring opinion noting that the statute in Lawrence violated the Equal Protection Clause, as it criminalized conduct between two males but not a male and female.\n\nHollingsworth v. Perry (2013) effectively allowed same-sex marriage to resume in California. In May 2008, California’s state Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage must be allowed under the state constitution; in November of that year, California voters passed Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Same-sex couples challenged the amendment in court as unconstitutional. Under governors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown, California chose not to defend the amendment; the amendment’s official proponents, including state senator Dennis Hollingsworth, then applied and were granted permission to defend the amendment. However, the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that because the amendment’s proponents could not demonstrate “personal and tangible harm” from the state’s inaction, they did not have standing under Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Anthony Kennedy dissented from the decision, which was announced on the same day as the U.S. v. Windsor decision.\n\nU.S. v. Windsor (2013) struck down the section of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act that prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages. Edie Windsor and Thea Spyer were married in Canada in 2007, having been a couple since the mid-1960s; New York state legally recognized their marriage in 2008. After Spyer died in 2009, Windsor was unable to claim a federal exemption from taxes on Spyer’s estate; she subsequently sued the federal government. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to defend the constitutionality of the law; instead, the U.S. House’s Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group defended the law in court. Justice Anthony Kennedy once again wrote the court’s majority opinion in the 5–4 decision, and held that Section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional, as it was a violation of the equal protection provided under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The federal government was subsequently required to recognize all state-sanctioned same-sex marriages as valid.\n\nObergefell v. Hodges (2015) legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. In denying to hear the appeal of the 1972 case Baker v. Nelson, the Supreme Court effectively set a legal precedent that denying marriage certificates to same-sex couples was constitutional; in 2014, the Sixth Circuit cited the Baker precedent in upholding certain state bans on same-sex marriage, including one originating from Ohio, where Jim Obergefell was unable to add his name to his husband’s death certificate, despite their having been legally married in Maryland. Anthony Kennedy once again wrote the Court’s 5–4 majority opinion, in which he cited precedents such as Griswold v. Connecticut, Lawrence v. Texas, and U.S. v. Windsor in holding that bans on same-sex marriage violate the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the oft-cited closing of the decision, Kennedy stated “It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves.”\n\nBostock v. Clayton County (2020), Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda (2020), and R. G. & G. R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2020), generally referred to collectively as Bostock, held that employees may not be fired or otherwise discriminated against due to their sexuality or gender identity. Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee “on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Gerald Bostock was fired from a government job in Georgia after joining a gay softball league, and discussing it at work. Donald Zarda was a skydiving instructor who was fired for telling a female student he was gay in an effort to make her more comfortable about a tandem dive. Aimee Stephens was fired after informing her employer of her transgender identity, and that she planned to dress as a female while following the company’s dress code. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a 6–3 majority opinion covering all three cases, holding that Title VII protects LGBT individuals from employment discrimination on the basis of sex, as employers were penalizing behavior for one sex while allowing it for the opposite sex. Both Zarda (BASE jumping accident) and Stephens (kidney failure) died before the decision was announced.\n\n303 Creative, LLC v. Elenis (2023) held that state anti-discrimination laws could not force someone to produce creative content that conflicts with their religious beliefs. Lorie Smith was a Colorado-based graphic designer who sued the state of Colorado, claiming the state’s anti-discrimination statute could force her to violate her religious beliefs by having to design a website for a same-sex wedding. In a 6–3 majority opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that Smith’s website designs were not an “ordinary commercial product”; rather, they were “expressive speech.” The First Amendment, Gorsuch stated, prohibited Colorado from forcing Smith to create expressive speech counter to her religious beliefs; the Court’s majority opinion intentionally did not offer a definition of “what qualifies as expressive activity protected by the First Amendment.” Gorsuch cited the Court’s ruling in Boy Scouts v. Dale as supporting the Court’s opinion in this case."

    "title": "Shakespearean Speeches, Monologues, And Soliloquies",
    "content": "The “To be, or not to be” soliloquy is delivered by Hamlet in act III, scene 1. The scene opens with King Claudius conversing with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern about the cause of Hamlet’s melancholy. To determine if Hamlet’s state is due to love for Ophelia, Claudius and Polonius (Ophelia’s father), ask Ophelia to speak with Hamlet while they listen in. Hamlet subsequently enters, delivering one of the most famous soliloquies in all of literature: To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles, And by opposing end them. Hamlet ponders whether death is preferable to the suffering of living, noting that To die, to sleep, to sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there’s the rub For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come. Hamlet goes on to refer to death as the “undiscovered country,” before noting that due to the unknown “ills” of death, “conscience does make cowards of us all.”\n\nMark Antony’s funeral oration is delivered in act III, scene 2 of Julius Caesar. Prior to Antony’s address, Brutus claims that his participation in the conspirators’ murder of Caesar was due to his love of Rome, claiming that “as [Caesar] was ambitious, I slew him.” Antony subsequently draws the attention of the crowd by exhorting “Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.” Antony begins by claiming I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them, The good is oft interred with their bones; So let it be with Caesar. Antony concedes that if Caesar was ambitious, “it was a grievous fault, / And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.” While tacitly acknowledging that Brutus and the conspirators are “honorable men,” Antony proceeds to counter their claim, noting that Caesar brought wealth to Rome via the ransoms of his captives, and that Caesar cared for the poor. He states You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition? Antony concludes with a flourish, lamenting “My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar / And I must pause till it come back to me.” Antony’s speech immediately turns public opinion against the conspirators.\n\n“All the world’s a stage” is a monologue delivered in act II, scene 7 of As You Like It by Jaques. A desperate Orlando has come upon the exiled Duke’s camp in the Forest of Arden, and demands food, threatening force if necessary, but the Duke warmly welcomes him. The sight of Orlando prompts Jaques to deliver a monologue noting All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages, giving the passage its alternate title, the Seven Ages of Man. Jaques describes the seven ages as the infant, the schoolboy, the lover, the soldier, the justice, the pantaloon, and second childishness. His description of old age is grim, noting that man ends “Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.”\n\nThe Saint Crispin’s Day speech is delivered by Henry V in act IV, scene 3. On the eve of the Battle of Agincourt against the French, Henry overhears Westmorland wishing they had but one in every 10,000 of the men left behind in England. Henry responds by delivering a speech noting “the fewer men, the greater share of honor,” before stating “he which hath no stomach to this fight, / Let him depart.” Henry remarks that the battle will be fought on Saint Crispin’s Day, and promises “He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, / Will stand a tip-toe when the day is nam’d.” The king rouses his men by describing his army as “We few, we happy few, we band of brothers” and ends by promising that gentlemen in England now a-bed Shall think themselves accurs’d they were not here, And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks That fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day. According to Shakespeare, in the subsequent battle, the French suffer over 10,000 casualties; the English, less than 30.\n\nThe “Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow” soliloquy is delivered by Macbeth in act V, scene 5, near the end of the play. Macbeth hears a “shriek” that he notes would have terrified him earlier in his life, but not after the “horrors” he has experienced in the play. Subsequently, Seyton informs him the cry was the death of Lady Macbeth, prompting Macbeth to muse “Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, / Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.” Macbeth likens death to the extinguishing of a flame, stating “Out, out, brief candle!” before noting that Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothing. William Faulkner adapted the soliloquy’s penultimate line for the title of his novel The Sound and the Fury.\n\n“Now is the winter of our discontent” is a monologue delivered by the future Richard III (then the Duke of Gloucester) to open act I, scene 1 of his namesake play. In the very first lines of the play, Richard remarks on the ascension of Edward IV amidst the Wars of the Roses, stating “Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this son of York.” Richard notes that Edward, having taken the throne, no longer rides into battle, but “capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber.” Richard, however, is an ugly, deformed, hunchback, describing himself as “rudely stamp’d” and lamenting that “dogs bark at me as I halt by them.” He resolves that since I cannot prove a lover, To entertain these fair well-spoken days, I am determined to prove a villain and describes the plot he has hatched to pit Edward against Richard’s brother Clarence. Richard finishes by contrasting himself with the king, stating “if King Edward be as true and just / As I am subtle, false, and treacherous, / This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up.”\n\n“Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks” is a monologue delivered by King Lear in act III, scene 2. Lear, having been taken in by the false flattery of his daughters Regan and Goneril—and having disinherited his honest daughter Cordelia—is enraged when Regan and Goneril betray him and refuse to honor their promises to house and care for him. Rushing out onto the heath, he addresses the storm raging overhead, shouting Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow! You cataracts and hurricanes, spout Till you have drench’d our steeples, drown’d the cocks! Lear’s fool, who accompanies him, urges Lear to apologize to his daughters and ask for shelter, but Lear refuses. He notes that the wind and rain never broke any promises to him, stating “I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness; / I never gave you kingdom, call’d you children.” Lear concludes by lamenting his foolishness and his plight, calling himself “A poor, infirm, weak, and despis’d old man” with “two pernicious daughters.” During the storm, Lear is eventually reunited with his faithful servant Kent.\n\nThe “Balcony Scene” in act II, scene 2 of Romeo and Juliet contains two of the best-known speeches in the entire play. Having fallen in love with Juliet after seeing her at Capulet’s ball, Romeo sneaks into the garden under her balcony to try and meet with her. Spying her at her window, he exclaims “But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? / It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.” Romeo watches and notes that Juliet is speaking to the stars; after he hears her voice the first time, he urges “O, speak again, bright angel!” Juliet—who does not realize Romeo is listening—longs for him, calling out “O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?” Juliet laments that the feud between their families forbids their love, urging Romeo “deny thy father and refuse thy name” before musing “What’s in a name? that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet.” Romeo subsequently reveals himself, and the two lovers speak to one another for the first time.\n\n“Hath not a Jew eyes?” is a speech delivered by the moneylender Shylock in act III, scene 1 of The Merchant of Venice. Although The Merchant of Venice contains many anti-Semitic elements, scholars have noted that Shakespeare’s characterization of Shylock also includes sympathetic moments. The messenger Salarino asks what good Shylock will get from the pound of flesh he plans to extract from Antonio. Shylock responds by stating “if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge” before listing the extensive injuries Antonio has inflicted upon him, concluding “and what’s his reason? I am a Jew.” Noting that Jews are human beings like Christians, Shylock asks “Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?” He goes on to note “If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?” Shylock explains that since Christians may seek revenge against Jews that wrong them, he is only responding in kind, pointing out the hypocrisy and noting “The villainy you teach me I will execute.”\n\n“Our revels now are ended” is a short speech delivered by Prospero in act IV, scene 1 of The Tempest. Prospero has blessed the impending marriage of his daughter Miranda to Ferdinand, the son of Alonso, and uses his magic to make the spirit Ariel present a masque featuring the goddesses Iris, Ceres, and Juno. However, Prospero interrupts the dancing when he realizes he must deal with a conspiracy involving Caliban. Noticing the disappointment of Ferdinand, Prospero reminds him that the play—like both life and the world entire—was fleeting, stating Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air. Prospero notes that eventually “the great globe itself, / Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve.” Once again, Shakespeare compares death to sleep and dreams, as Prospero states We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep. Prospero’s line is often misquoted as “such stuff as dreams are made of,” rather than “on.”"

    "title": "American Murders And Murderers",
    "content": "The Lizzie Borden axe murders (Fall River, Massachusetts, 1892) Lizzie Borden lived with her sister Emma, their real-estate manager father Andrew, and their stepmother Abby. On August 4, 1892, the Bordens’ housekeeper Maggie heard Lizzie yelling that Andrew and Abby had been killed. Both had been killed with an axe; during subsequent searches, police found axes and axe-heads in the cellar. Lizzie constantly changed her account of events; her burning of an allegedly paint-stained dress further aroused suspicion. The murder was sensationalized in the press. At trial, Lizzie’s erratic inquest testimony—given under the influence of morphine—was thrown out, as was testimony that she tried to buy prussic acid (a poison) the day before the murders. She was found not guilty and lived in Fall River until her death 35 years later. The case—and Lizzie’s assumed guilt—gave rise to the popular schoolyard rhyme beginning “Lizzie Borden took an axe / and gave her mother forty whacks.”\n\nHarry K. Thaw’s murder of Stanford White (New York City, 1901) Stanford White was an eminent architect who designed New York’s Washington Square Arch and Penn Station. Harry K. Thaw, a millionaire and railroad heir, shot and killed White in front of a crowd of hundreds atop Madison Square Garden. Thaw claimed that his wife, a fashion model and chorus girl named Evelyn Nesbit, was allegedly raped by White three years prior; Thaw believed he had acted chivalrously in performing an “honor killing.” The media sensation surrounding the trial caused the jury to be sequestered for the first time in an American criminal case. The first jury deadlocked; following a retrial, Thaw was found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. After the trial, Thaw aggressively silenced his detractors via payoffs and legal threats, while Nesbit, even after divorce in 1915, was unable to escape the shadow of the crime. Author E. L. Doctorow incorporated the murder into his novel Ragtime.\n\nThe Leopold and Loeb murder (Chicago, 1924) Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb were two rich schoolmates (and, according to most modern scholars, lovers) obsessed with Friedrich Nietzsche’s concept of the Übermensch, an ideal human unbound by earthly morals. At ages 19 and 18 respectively, Leopold and Loeb chose to prove they were Übermenschen by committing a “perfect crime”: they kidnapped fourteen-year-old Bobby Franks, killed him with a chisel, doused the body in acid, and wrote fake ransom letters under the alias “George Johnson.” However, police quickly found Franks’s body, as well as a nearby pair of eyeglasses with unique hinges that had been sold to Leopold. To avoid the death penalty, Loeb’s parents hired lawyer Clarence Darrow, who had both perpetrators enter guilty pleas and delivered a 12-hour speech that resulted in sentences of life imprisonment. Leopold was paroled in 1958 and moved to Puerto Rico; Loeb was murdered by a fellow inmate in 1936.\n\nThe Lindbergh Baby murder (New Jersey, 1932) The kidnapping of the infant son of Charles Lindbergh, the first aviator to cross the Atlantic non-stop, made instant nationwide headlines. The baby was taken from his nursery; a ransom letter signed with a symbol resembling a dark blot inside a Venn diagram was left behind. Later ransom letters allegedly authorized John Condon, a public figure in the Bronx, to act as an intermediary. Condon met with a man nicknamed “Cemetery John” in Woodlawn Cemetery; after the baby’s sleeping clothes were sent as proof, the ransom was paid in gold certificates. A truck driver discovered the baby’s corpse two months after the kidnapping. Reports of a suspicious man redeeming gold certificates in Manhattan led police to Bruno Hauptmann, who possessed $14,000 in certificates that matched the serial numbers of the ransom money. He also had Condon’s telephone number scrawled on a wall in his home. Hauptmann was tried, found guilty, and executed in 1936. The crime spurred passage of the Federal Kidnapping Act, giving federal authorities power in kidnappings that cross state lines.\n\nThe Black Dahlia murder (Los Angeles, 1947) The body of Elizabeth Short, a waitress, was discovered in a vacant lot; her corpse had mutilated and luridly posed. The brutal crime was originally known as the “Werewolf Murder” until a newspaper gave Short the nickname “the Black Dahlia,” likely invented to evoke the popular 1946 film noir The Blue Dahlia. Before authorities were able to notify Short’s next-of-kin, a reporter for the Los Angeles Examiner telephoned Short’s mother in Boston, claiming Short won a beauty contest to get as much material as possible before telling her the truth. Nine days later, the Examiner received an envelope containing Short’s personal effects, addressed using words cut-and-pasted from magazines; the message was deemed genuine because it was cleaned with gasoline, like Short’s body. Police were never able to solve the crime, in part because the extreme media exposure generated countless false leads, including claims that Short was an aspiring actress.\n\nThe murder of Kitty Genovese (New York City, 1964) Shortly after 3:00 a.m. on March 13, 1964, Kitty Genovese was murdered outside her apartment building by Winston Moseley. According to popular belief, the murder was witnessed by over 30 people, none of who responded to Genovese’s screams for help; the New York Times subsequently ran the headline “Thirty-Eight Who Saw Murder Didn’t Call the Police.” The murder is often cited as an example of the “bystander effect,” in which people are paradoxically less likely to render help if they are in a large group, via a “diffusion of responsibility.” Modern studies have called the popular conception of the crime into question: Genovese’s stab wounds likely rendered her unable to scream, two witnesses did call police, no witness saw the crime in its entirety, and the many witnesses believed the initial attack was a lovers’ quarrel.\n\nThe Zodiac murders (California, 1968-1969) The Zodiac Killer murdered at least five people (and attacked two more who survived) in Benicia, Vallejo, and Presidio Heights in California’s Bay Area; he claimed to have killed 37. Bryan Hartnell, who survived an attack by the killer at Lake Berryessa, described him as a man in a black executioner’s hood and a bib with a crosshair symbol. The criminal’s nickname is what he called himself in a series of letters sent to newspapers in the San Francisco area, which he signed with the same crosshair symbol; the letters contained ciphers, in which the killer claimed to be collecting slaves for the afterlife. His final letter, received in 1974, calls the film The Exorcist a “comedy.” Although numerous suspects were investigated—including Arthur Leigh Allen and Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber)—the crimes remain unsolved.\n\nTed Bundy’s murders (nationwide, 1974–1978) Ted Bundy was a serial killer who claimed to have murdered at least 30 women, most of them in the American west. Bundy lured most of his victims to his car by feigning a disability or impersonating a policeman. In 1977 he was arrested near Salt Lake City after trying to flee police in a Volkswagen that many would-be victims mentioned in police reports. While on trial in Colorado, Bundy escaped from custody twice. His first escape lasted a week; after escaping a second time, in December, he travelled to Florida and killed at least three more people before being recaptured. Throughout his trials and jail term, Bundy reveled in his notoriety and was noted for his unusual ability to charm people. During his 1980 murder trial in Florida he married Carole Ann Boone, a sympathetic witness, in court while she was on the witness stand. Bundy was executed in 1989.\n\nMurder of John Lennon (New York City, 1980) John Lennon, a member of the Beatles, was shot outside Manhattan’s Dakota Apartments on December 8, 1980 by Mark David Chapman. Chapman claimed to have been inspired by the character of Holden Caulfield in J. D. Salinger’s novel The Catcher in the Rye; he claimed that he had written the phrase “This is my statement” in the copy he was carrying on the night of the murder. Chapman hated Lennon for his anti-war stance and songs like “Imagine,” which discounted Christianity. The first widespread public announcement of Lennon’s death was made by sports commentator Howard Cosell, who stopped commentating on Monday Night Football to report that Lennon had been murdered. Chapman pleaded guilty to murder. Although he became eligible for parole in 2000, his application for parole has been denied 11 times as of 2021.\n\nThe Columbine massacre (Columbine, Colorado, 1999) On April 20, 1999 Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered thirteen people—one teacher and twelve students—and injured over 20 others, before committing suicide, during an assault on Columbine High School. The assault, which lasted nearly an hour, included bombs placed in the cafeteria and car bombs, none of which ever detonated. Victims Rachel Scott and Cassie Bernall were later portrayed as martyrs by Christian evangelicals. The attack inflamed a moral panic over violent video games (such as Doom), rock musician Marilyn Manson, and goth subculture (as both Harris and Klebold were widely reported to belong to a clique called the “Trenchcoat Mafia” and wore dusters during the assault). Social critics have argued that harsh zero-tolerance policies instituted in the wake of Columbine have played a key role in the school-to-prison pipeline."

    "title": "Baroque Painters",
    "content": "Caravaggio (1571–1610; full name Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio) was an Italian painter who developed a style of painting involving chiaroscuro, or stark contrast between darkness and vibrant light, that was known as tenebrism. One of Caravaggio’s best-known paintings is The Calling of Saint Matthew, in which Christ, who is at the right, points at a group of men sitting at a table illuminated by a shaft of light; scholars have debated whether a bearded man at the table is pointing at himself or at the young man sitting next to him. Caravaggio’s Amor Vincit Omnia (meaning “Love Conquers All”) shows a naked Cupid trampling musical instruments and a set of armor. Caravaggio led a violent life; he was forced to flee Rome after being sentenced to death for murder. Caravaggio was greatly influential during and after his life; artists who imitated or were influenced by his style were known as “Caravaggisti.”\n\nArtemisia Gentileschi (1593–1656) was an Italian painter whose work includes numerous biblical and mythical scenes, as well as many self-portraits—including one showing her as Saint Catherine and another showing her at work painting. As a teenager, Gentileschi was raped by painter Agostino Tassi; during the public trial that resulted after her father Orazio (also a painter) pressed charges, Gentileschi testified against Tassi while being tortured to supposedly ensure that her account was truthful. Gentileschi’s most notable works include her depictions of Judith Slaying Holofernes, in which she showed herself as the biblical slayer of an Assyrian general; she may have also painted Tassi’s face on Holofernes. The painting, which was partly inspired by a similar Caravaggio painting, is extremely graphic for its time: blood spurts from Holofernes’s neck as Judith coldly saws through it with a sword.\n\nFrans Hals (1582–1666) was a Dutch painter who worked in the city of Haarlem, and who created some of the best-known portraits of the Dutch Baroque. Many of Hals’s works are tronies (from the Dutch word for “face”), which are portraits in which the subject has an unusual, artificial facial expression or costume. Hals’s best known painting is The Laughing Cavalier, a 1624 portrait of a man in a wide-brimmed hat and extravagant clothes with an upturned moustache and a bemused expression (notably, the subject of the portrait is not actually laughing); because the subject of the painting looks straight forward, the painting’s eyes seem to follow the viewer. Hals’s other works include a portrait of a Gypsy Girl in a white shirt and red bodice, as well as Malle Babbe, which shows a witch-like folk character holding a stein as an owl sits on her shoulder.\n\nJudith Leyster (1609–1660) was a painter of the Dutch Golden Age who worked mainly in portraits and genre scenes. Her notable works include The Proposition, an early feminist work in which a woman pointedly ignores a man offering her a handful of gold coins in exchange for sex while she focuses on sewing by candlelight; the footwarmer under her dress indicates she is married and is behaving virtuously. Her Self-Portrait shows her unrealistically in fine dress, working on a canvas showing a man in blue playing the violin. Leyster was married to fellow artist Jan Miense Molenaer; after her death, her work was largely attributed to either her husband or Frans Hals. Leyster was not credited as the painter of her works until the late 1800s.\n\nNicolas Poussin (1594–1665) was a French painter who did most of his productive work in Italy. Poussin’s output mainly consisted of mythical, biblical, and historical scenes. Poussin’s notable works include Et in Arcadia Ego, a pastoral scene showing three shepherds and a woman examining a tomb on which the painting’s title has been carved. The title—a Latin phrase roughly meaning “I am even in Arcadia”—refers to the universal nature of death, and is an artistic memento mori, or reminder of human mortality. Poussin’s mythology paintings include A Dance to the Music of Time—which shows Apollo’s chariot in the sky above four figures dancing in a circle as an elderly representation of Time plays a lyre—and a depiction of The Rape of the Sabine Women.\n\nRembrandt van Rijn (1606–1669) was a Dutch painter widely regarded as one of the greatest painters to have ever lived. His The Night Watch is a massive canvas showing a militia company led by Frans Banninck Cocq, who appears at the painting’s center in a red sash; behind Cocq is a woman with a chicken hanging from her belt. The painting was once larger than it is today; it was cut down to fit into a display space, with the trimmed parts lost. Rembrandt’s The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp shows the title surgeon using forceps to hold up the muscles of an arm for other physicians to see; the corpse being dissected is that of a recently-executed criminal. Rembrandt is renowned for his many self-portraits, both as himself in normal clothing (such as with his Self-Portrait with Two Circles), and as other characters (including as the title figure in The Prodigal Son in the Tavern, alongside his wife Saskia).\n\nPeter Paul Rubens (1577–1640) was a Flemish painter who also served as a diplomat; his travels on diplomatic affairs allowed him to study art held in many different areas of Europe. Rubens worked in nearly all major genres of painting of his time, including portraits (such as his numerous depictions of his second wife, Helena Fourment), biblical scenes (such as his 1614 Descent from the Cross, part of a triptych), mythological works (such as his The Origin of the Milky Way, a scene also painted by Tintoretto), and various landscapes. Rubens’s Marie de’ Medici cycle is a set of 24 portraits and highly allegorical works showing events from the life of Marie de’ Medici, who was the queen of France, wife of Henry IV, and mother of Louis XIII; the cycle includes The Coronation in Saint-Denis and The Triumph of Truth. Rubens is known for his many depictions of the nude female body in a full-figured, fleshy state.\n\nAnthony van Dyck (1599–1641) was a Flemish painter who created his most recognizable works while living and working in England. Van Dyck trained and worked for many years in the studio of Peter Paul Rubens. In 1632 van Dyck was appointed the court painter to Charles I of England, whom he depicted in numerous portraits, including several equestrian portraits showing the king atop a horse in full black armor. Van Dyck’s Charles I at the Hunt shows the king leaning on a walking stick and casually looking over his left shoulder while resting his left hand on his hip, next to a horse that is lowering its head. While in England, van Dyck also painted many portraits of English nobility and other court figures, such as his works depicting Henrietta Maria and Princess Mary.\n\nDiego Velázquez (1599–1660) was the leading Spanish painter of the Baroque era and served as court painter to Philip IV of Spain. Velázquez’s masterpieces include Las Meninas, which shows the Infanta Margaret Theresa alongside her maids, dwarfs, and a dog; the painting also includes a self-portrait of Velázquez, who is at work on a large canvas, as well as the king and queen, who appear in a mirror on the background wall. Velázquez’s mythology-inspired works include the Rokeby Venus (so named because it was first displayed in England at Rokeby Park), in which a nude reclining Venus gazes at herself in a mirror being held up by Cupid. Velázquez also painted The Surrender of Breda, showing the moment after a military victory when the Spanish general Ambrogio Spinola was given the key to the title Dutch city.\n\nJohannes Vermeer (1632–1675) was a Dutch painter who lived and worked in the city of Delft, which he depicted in his 1660 work View of Delft—one of the earliest prominent examples of a cityscape in painting. Only 34 recognized works by Vermeer have survived to the modern day. Of these, likely the best-known is Girl With a Pearl Earring, which shows a young woman in a blue and gold turban looking back over her left shoulder, highlighting the title piece of jewelry; the painting inspired a novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier. Vermeer’s The Music Lesson shows a young girl with her back to the viewer playing a virginal, as a man standing next to her sings. Vermeer’s works have been the subject of theories advanced by artists and scholars, including British painter David Hockney, that claim Vermeer used a camera obscura to assist in painting his works."

    "title": "Psychological Experiments And Studies",
    "content": "Ivan Pavlov’s classical conditioning experiments (1901) were among the first to study the ways in which unrelated unconditioned and neutral stimuli could be linked together through repetition to produce a conditioned response. Pavlov, who studied the digestive tracts of dogs (work that won him the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine), noticed that his canine subjects began to salivate as soon as they saw the lab assistant who normally fed them, which he called “psychic secretion.” Pavlov designed an experiment in which dogs heard the sound of a metronome (commonly misidentified as a bell) and were then presented with food. With repetition, the neutral stimulus of the metronome became linked to the unconditioned stimulus of food and the unconditioned response of salivation to produce the conditioned response of salivating at the sound of the metronome.\n\nThe Little Albert experiment (1920) was carried out by psychologist John Watson, with assistance from Rosalie Rayner, to test if it was possible to intentionally condition fear in an otherwise normal child. Watson initially exposed an infant test subject (identified by the pseudonym “Albert”) to numerous white, fluffy stimuli, such as a rat, a rabbit, and wool; the infant displayed no fear of these items. Watson then began to expose the infant to a white rat, while banging a bar with a hammer to create a loud, scary noise whenever the infant interacted with the rat. Eventually, Albert began to react with distress when exposed to any white fluffy stimuli, including a Santa Claus mask. The experiment has been heavily criticized on both ethical grounds (for the infliction of trauma on an infant) and on procedural grounds (as one child identified as potentially being “Little Albert” may have been born with serious cognitive impairment).\n\nThe Skinner box (first used ca. 1930) was an apparatus developed by psychologist B. F. Skinner during his time as a graduate student at Harvard to explore the effects of operant conditioning, in which a behavior may be increased or decreased through the use of reinforcement or punishment, respectively. The design of the Skinner box is similar to the puzzle box developed earlier by Edward Thorndike. The most basic Skinner box consists of a small chamber, into which an animal is introduced, and a lever (or button, or other apparatus), which Skinner called a “manipulandum.” The manipulandum can deliver food, turn off an electrified floor, or in some other way affect the environment inside the box positively or negatively. The animal’s interaction with the lever allows researchers to observe changes in behavior in response to repeated reinforcements or punishments.\n\nThe Clark doll experiment (1940) studied the perception of race in children. Mamie Phipps Clark and Kenneth Clark were a married team of psychologists and the first African Americans to receive doctorates in psychology at Columbia University. In a series of studies, they presented children across the country—from all races—with dolls that were identical except for skin color and hairstyle. They then asked the children to identify the “nice doll,” the “bad doll,” and other questions involving subjective judgments. The results of the study indicated that children of all races showed a preference for the white doll, indicating that racism in American society created an inherent sense of inferiority in Black children even by the age of five. The Clark’s research was cited by the Supreme Court in its decision in Brown v. Board of Education ordering the desegregation of schools.\n\nThe first Asch conformity experiment (1951) was designed and run by Solomon Asch at Swarthmore College in an attempt to see whether individuals would conform to the thinking of a group of peers in a situation in which the group was clearly wrong. Participants in the experiment were paired with seven other people—all of whom were in on the plan. The groups were shown a “base” line, then were shown three other lines, and were asked to pick which of the three other lines was the same length as the “base” line. On pre-planned trials, the seven confederates each intentionally picked a line that was clearly a different length than the “base” line. In nearly 40 percent of these trials, the subject of the experiment also gave an incorrect answer, likely to conform with the answer provided by the others.\n\nThe Milgram obedience experiment (1961) (often just called the “Milgram experiment”) was carried out at Yale University by psychologist Stanley Milgram. Milgram was inspired to conduct the experiment by the high-profile trial of Adolf Eichmann, who claimed the Nazis carrying out the Holocaust did it because they were merely “following orders.” In Milgram’s experiment, the subject was led to believe they were administering electric shocks to a “learner” (who was assisting in running the experiment) to punish the learner for making mistakes. Subjects were ordered to increase the voltage to dangerously high levels as the experiment continued, as the learner screamed in pain and pleaded with them to stop; if they stopped to question whether the experiment was safe, they were told to continue. Over 60 percent of participants eventually administered shocks so powerful that they would have killed the learner had they been real.\n\nThe Bobo doll experiment (1961) was carried out by Albert Bandura at Stanford University, who wanted to study the effect of watching an adult model on the behavior of children. Children in the experiment observed an adult interacting with a “Bobo doll,” a large self-righting toy designed to look like a clown. In some cases, the adult completely ignored the doll; in other cases, the adult was highly aggressive toward the doll, to the extent of throwing it, hitting it with a mallet, and yelling at it. Bandura found that children who observed an adult acting aggressively toward the doll were far more likely to act aggressively towards the doll themselves, as compared to children who watched a model ignoring the doll. The experiment provided support for the idea of social learning theory, which holds that behaviors may be learned by observing models.\n\nThe original Small-World experiment (1966–1967) was carried out by Stanley Milgram (who also carried out the obedience experiment) to examine the interconnectedness of Americans. Milgram mailed a number of people in Nebraska and Kansas a package, and asked them to send it to a target in Boston. If they knew the individual in Boston, they could send it directly to the target; if they did not, they were instructed to send it to a personal acquaintance who they believed would be most likely to know the person in Boston. This process continued until the package reached the final person in Boston. The experiment showed that, of the packages that did make their way to Boston, they typically did so in five or six steps, leading to the coining of the phrase “six degrees of separation.” The experiment was an important early study of social networks.\n\nMartin Seligman’s learned helplessness experiments (1967) were instrumental in identifying that individuals who believe they are powerless to stop a harmful stimulus will eventually stop trying to avoid it at all. Seligman divided a number of dogs into three groups: one group which received no electric shocks, one group that received electric shocks but could stop them by pressing a lever, and one group which was led to believe they had no control over when the shocks stopped or started. Each group of dogs was then placed into a new situation where they were given shocks but presented an easy means of escape. While the first two groups of dogs each quickly escaped from the shocks, the third group—those given no control over the initial shocks—made no attempt at escape. The experiment had major implications for the understanding and treatment of clinical depression via therapy.\n\nThe Stanford prison experiment (1971) was designed by Philip Zimbardo to study the effects of power dynamics in custodial situations. Participants—college students at Stanford University—were randomly assigned to be “guards” or “prisoners” for a two-week period; the guards were instructed to refer to the prisoners only by their number, not their name. Although the experience was designed to be structured, by the second day prisoners had begun to rebel against the guards, and guards (including one nicknamed “John Wayne”) began to implement sadistic practices designed to degrade, humiliate, and dehumanize inmates. The experiment was stopped after only six days when Christina Maslach, a psychology graduate student, raised ethical objections. Zimbardo later analyzed the experiment in a book which compared the events of the Stanford prison to the abuses at Abu Ghraib. Many aspects of the experiment and its legitimacy have been questioned or disputed by contemporary researchers and experiment participants."

    "title": "Presidential Inaugurations",
    "content": "George Washington’s first inauguration (1789) was the first to be held under the nation’s new Constitution. Washington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, though the president’s term officially began on March 4 (and Vice President John Adams was inaugurated on April 21). Washington was sworn in at Federal Hall in New York City, which at the time was serving as the nation’s capital. The oath of office was administered by Robert Livingston, the chancellor of New York and co-author of the Declaration of Independence. In his inaugural address, Washington claimed “no event could have filled me with greater anxieties” than assuming the presidency, and described how he was “summoned by my country” from “a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection.”\n\nThe inauguration of John Adams (1797) took place on March 4 at Congress Hall in the then-current national capital, Philadelphia, as work on the new national capital at Washington, D.C. was not yet complete. (Adams became the first president to live in the White House in 1800). Adams was the first president to be sworn in by the chief justice. The transfer of power from Washington to Adams was the first peaceful transition from a living head of state to a succeeding head of state anywhere in the world in over 70 years. In his address, Adams noted that he first read the new Constitution while in a foreign country, and praised it as the “result of good heads prompted by good hearts.”\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison (1841) was inaugurated on March 4 after defeating Martin Van Buren in the election of 1840. His death on April 4, exactly one month after his inauguration, kicked off a constitutional crisis, as it was unclear whether his vice president, John Tyler, would succeed him by actually becoming the president or merely serving as the “acting president.” At his inauguration, Harrison delivered an 8,000-plus-word speech that lasted two hours. Popular notions in American folklore hold that Harrison’s long speech, delivered without wearing a coat, led him to catch pneumonia; it is far more likely, however, that he died of misdiagnosed typhoid and poor medical treatment.\n\nThe second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln (1865) took place a little over one month before Lincoln’s assassination. Lincoln’s second inaugural address is among the most quoted pieces of American oratory. After noting that the Union and the Confederacy “[b]oth read the same Bible, and pray to the same God,” Lincoln concluded his speech by stating “With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.” Many scholars believe that photos of Lincoln delivering his address show John Wilkes Booth on the Capitol balcony looking down at the president.\n\nThe first inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933) took place in the midst of the Great Depression. Roosevelt opened his inaugural address by proclaiming his “firm belief” that “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” After declaring that “[o]ur greatest primary task is to put people to work,” Roosevelt requested from Congress “broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.” This was the last presidential inauguration to take place on March 4; Roosevelt was inaugurated for his second term on January 20, 1937, per the Twentieth Amendment.\n\nThe inauguration of John F. Kennedy (1961) was the first presidential inauguration to be broadcast live in color. In his inaugural address, Kennedy noted that “few generations” are tasked with “defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger.” Kennedy stated that he “welcome[d]” the responsibility, saying that “[t]he energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it—and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.” In the most quoted moment of the speech, Kennedy then stated “And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” Poet Robert Frost recited his poem “The Gift Outright” during the ceremony, making Frost the first poet to participate in an inauguration; Frost also wrote a new poem to read, but was unable to do so in the bright sun of the day.\n\nRonald Reagan’s first inauguration (1981) was the first in nearly 150 years to take place on the west side of the Capitol, so that Reagan faced the National Mall as he was sworn in. Reagan’s inauguration coincided with the release of the 52 Americans who were held for 444 days during the Iran hostage crisis. In his address, Reagan noted that while in U.S. history, the “orderly transfer of authority” in an inauguration was “a commonplace occurrence,” that “[i]n the eyes of many in the world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.” Reagan’s address ended by describing the diary of Martin Treptow, an American soldier who was killed during World War I. The inauguration set a record for television viewership (approximately 42 million) that stands to this day.\n\nThe first inauguration of Barack Obama (2009) set a record for in-person attendance at any presidential inauguration. The swearing-in of Obama did not go smoothly: Chief Justice John Roberts made a mistake in the words of the oath of office, and Obama accidentally spoke over him at one point. Roberts re-administered the oath of office to Obama the next day. Obama’s address was widely viewed as a sharp rebuke of George W. Bush; in his speech, Obama noted “we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.” The ceremony featured a performance of the quartet “Air and Simple Gifts,” by film composer John Williams, which was actually mimed to an earlier taped recording, as there were concerns about the instruments remaining in tune on the cold January day.\n\nThe inauguration of Donald Trump (2017) aroused a great deal of controversy due to the Trump administration’s claims about attendance numbers. Press secretary Sean Spicer cited false Washington Metro ridership numbers to attempt to show that more people attended Trump’s inauguration than Obama’s; Kellyanne Conway later described these numbers as “alternative facts.” During his address, Trump described poverty, crime, gangs, and drugs as “American carnage” and invoked the World War II-era isolationist group by stating “from this day forward, it’s going to be only America first.” The Women’s March on Washington, which took place the day after the inauguration, involved over 400,000 people and protested Trump’s misogynist and offensive behavior.\n\nJoseph R. Biden (2021) became the oldest person to ever be president when he was sworn in at 78 years old. His vice president, Kamala Harris, also made history as the first woman and first person of color to hold the vice presidency. Biden’s inauguration had extremely limited in-person attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic; a “field of flags” was set up on the National Mall in lieu of spectators. In his inaugural address, given two weeks to the day after an insurrectionist mob stormed the Capitol trying to overturn the election result, Biden proclaimed “at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,” before calling on Americans to “end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.” During the ceremony, 22-year-old Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman read her poem “The Hill We Climb.”"

    "title": "Romantic-era Composers",
    "content": "Franz Schubert (1797–1828) was an early Romantic composer from Vienna whose relatively short life largely overlapped with that of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827). Schubert wrote over 600 lieder, or German art songs. These lieder include works notable on their own, such as his Op. 1 “Die Erlkönig”; the two song cycles Die schöne Müllerin and Winterreise; and lieder which he used as the basis for theme and variations movements in other namesake works, such as the “Trout” Quintet (for piano and string quartet, based on his lied “The Trout,” or “Die Forelle”). Schubert’s orchestral output included numerous symphonies, the most well-known of which are No. 8 in B minor, the “Unfinished” (so named because Schubert only ever completed two movements), and No. 9 in C major, known as the “Great C Major” (in part to distinguish it from No. 6, the “Little C Major”).\n\nHector Berlioz (1803–1869) was the most prominent French composer of the early Romantic. His best-known work, the programmatic Symphonie fantastique (subtitled “An Episode in the Life of an Artist”), was inspired by his obsession with the actress Harriet Smithson, whom Berlioz would later marry (and divorce). The work, whose movements include vivid depictions of a “March to the Scaffold” and a “Dream of a Witches’ Sabbath,” uses a recurring melody known as an idée fixe. Berlioz’s Harold in Italy is a work for solo viola and orchestra, which the composer claimed was inspired in part by Lord Byron’s poem Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage. Harold in Italy was commissioned by Niccolò Paganini, who subsequently abandoned the project because he felt that the viola was not sufficiently showcased, and who never performed the work. Berlioz’s opera Les Troyens (based on the Aeneid), is a massive production that—while never completely performed while Berlioz was alive—is now often listed among the greatest operas ever written.\n\nFelix Mendelssohn (1809–1847) was a German musical prodigy who completed his first symphony when he was only 15 years old. Mendelssohn’s five completed, published symphonies are numbered for the order in which they were published, not the order in which they were written. His “Italian” (No. 4 in A major) and “Scottish” (No. 3 in A minor) symphonies were inspired by his travels in the namesake countries. Mendelssohn’s journey through Scotland included a trip to Fingal’s Cave, which inspired his “Hebrides” Overture, whose theme he sketched on a postcard to his sister Fanny (who was also a composer). When Mendelssohn was 17 years old, he wrote a concert overture inspired by Shakespeare’s play A Midsummer Night’s Dream; many years later, he wrote a complete set of incidental music for the play, including his famous “Wedding March.” Mendelssohn’s non-orchestral music includes eight books of Songs Without Words for solo piano.\n\nRobert Schumann (1810–1854) was a German composer and music critic who identified and promoted many of the other best-known composers of the 19th century. Schumann edited Neue Zeitschrift für Musik (“New Journal for Music”) and lauded the music of Frederic Chopin and Johannes Brahms while both were relatively unknown. Schumann’s early music mainly consisted of works for solo piano, such as Carnaval, which features a musical cryptogram. In 1841, he began to write orchestral music; his four completed symphonies include No. 1 in B-flat major, “Spring,” and No. 3 in E-flat major, the “Rhenish.” Schumann married Clara Wieck, the daughter of Friedrich Wieck, Schumann’s piano teacher, and a virtuoso pianist and composer in her own right. Schumann battled mental illness throughout much of his life; he spent the last two years of his life in a mental asylum after attempting and failing to commit suicide.\n\nFranz Liszt (1811–1886) was a Hungarian virtuoso pianist and composer who created a sensation with his performance tours across Europe, spawning a phenomenon that was given the nickname “Lisztomania.” Among Liszt’s innovations in the performance space, he was the first pianist to give solo concert-length recitals, playing entirely from memory. As a composer, Liszt was seen as the head of a more progressive “New German School” of music. His music for the piano includes the notoriously-difficult Transcendental Études and the Hungarian Rhapsodies, which are based on Hungarian folk music. Liszt wrote numerous works inspired by the tale of Faust, including a Faust Symphony and a set of Mephisto Waltzes. Liszt is also generally credited with inventing the orchestral genre of the symphonic poem or tone poem, a form later taken up by Richard Strauss; Liszt’s own works in this genre include Les préludes.\n\nGiuseppe Verdi (1813–1901) was one of the most prolific and successful Italian opera composers of the Romantic period, and his operas include some of the most performed works in the repertoire. Aida is the tale of a captive Ethiopian princess (who longs for her homeland in the aria “O patria mia”) who falls in love with the Egyptian general Radamès. Rigoletto tells the story of a hunchbacked jester who seeks revenge on the womanizing Duke of Mantua (who sings “La donna è mobile”), but instead ends up causing the death of his own daughter, Gilda. Verdi’s late operas include two masterpieces based on the works of Shakespeare: Otello and Falstaff, the latter of which was both Verdi’s last opera and his only successful comedy. Verdi’s most successful non-operatic work is his Requiem, whose “Dies irae” movement has seen wide use in popular culture.\n\nRichard Wagner (1813—1883) was the most influential German opera composer of the 19th century. Wagner’s four-opera Ring Cycle—consisting of Das Rheingold, Die Walküre (The Valkyrie), Siegfried, and Götterdämmerung (Twilight of the Gods)—tells the story of a magical ring forged by the Nibelung (dwarf) Alberich, which Alberich curses after it is stolen by Odin; the second of these operas includes the orchestral excerpt “Ride of the Valkyries.” Wagner’s other operas include Lohengrin, the tale of a knight who arrives in a boat pulled by a swan, and which includes a “Bridal Chorus” popularly known as “Here Comes the Bride”; and Tristan and Isolde, whose prelude begins with an iconic chord (which has become known as the “Tristan chord”) that is often cited as a break with common practice-era harmony. The annual Bayreuth Festival (in Bayreuth, Germany) showcases performances of Wagner’s works. Wagner was a virulent antisemite; many critics have interpreted Alberich, the villain of the Ring Cycle, as an offensive stereotype of a Jewish person.\n\nJohannes Brahms (1833–1897) is often described as one of the “Three B’s” of classical music, along with J. S. Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven, and his output covered the entire gamut of genres. Brahms’s Symphony No. 1 in C minor is nicknamed “Beethoven’s Tenth” due to the final movement’s resemblance to the “Ode to Joy” in Beethoven’s Ninth. Brahms’s Symphony No. 3 in F major is based on a three-note F–A–F motto, representing the phrase “Frei aber froh,” or “Free but happy.” His Ein deutsches Requiem, or A German Requiem, is a non-liturgical concert work for chorus and orchestra. Brahms was also a prolific composer of chamber music, writing numerous sonatas and trios. His Op. 49 No. 4 “Wiegenlied” is commonly known as “Brahms’ Lullaby.” During his lifetime, Brahms was often viewed as the head of a more conservative school of music relative to composers like Wagner and Liszt.\n\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–1893) was a Russian composer of the Romantic era whose ballets The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, and Sleeping Beauty are all among the most performed works in the standard repertoire. Tchaikovsky completed six numbered symphonies and an unnumbered symphony based on Lord Byron’s poem Manfred. Although he was not a part of the group of nationalistic Russian composers known as “The Mighty Five,” it was Tchaikovsky’s correspondence with the Five’s leader Mily Balakirev that led to Tchaikovsky’s Romeo and Juliet, an “overture-fantasy” whose love theme has become ubiquitous in popular culture. His 1812 Overture, a programmatic work depicting Napoleon’s army being driven out of Russia, quotes the melodies of “God Save the Tsar” and “La Marseillaise,” and calls for cannons to be fired in the score. Tchaikovsky was gay, and many have speculated that his death shortly after the premiere of his Sixth Symphony, the “Pathétique,” was effectively suicide.\n\nAntonín Dvořák (1841–1904) was a Czech composer who, ironically, wrote his two best-known works while living in America. From 1892 to 1895, Dvořák was the director of New York’s National Conservatory of Music; while living in the U.S., he wrote his Symphony No. 9 (“From the New World”) and his “American” String Quartet (No. 12). The “New World” symphony is among the most popular and oft-performed works in the standard repertoire; its Largo second movement begins with an iconic English horn solo that was later adapted into the song “Goin’ Home.” Dvořák claimed that the material of the symphony was inspired by the styles of both African-American and Native American melodies, though all of the actual music is Dvořák’s own. Dvořák’s other works include two sets of Slavonic Dances, which are based on various styles of folk music—but no actual folk melodies—from Dvořák’s native Bohemia, including the dumka and the furiant."

    "title": "World's Fairs",
    "content": "London, 1851: Great Exhibition” The Great Exhibition was the first ever “World’s Fair.” The event was largely organized by Prince Albert and was held in the “Crystal Palace,” a structure nearly three times larger than St. Paul’s Cathedral. Exhibitors included Samuel Colt, who brought a prototype of his “Navy” pistol, and Mathew Brady, a pioneer of daguerreotypes. A boating race held in conjunction with the exhibition was won by a ship called America, leading to its prize becoming known as the America’s Cup. It also featured the world’s first modern pay toilets, which cost a penny to use. The Crystal Palace remained in use for decades after the event was over, but was destroyed by a fire in 1936.\n\nParis, 1889: Exposition Universelle Although Paris had hosted the World’s Fair three times before, its 1889 event was easily its most iconic. It is best known for its centerpiece, the Eiffel Tower, which was by far the tallest structure in the world when it was completed. Exhibits were placed throughout the Champ de Mars, including the “Streets of Cairo,” an elaborate interpretation of Egypt’s capital. Another of its most popular attractions was a “human zoo,” in which various indigenous and other non-white people were put on display, a practice that was largely accepted at the time. The Eiffel Tower was scheduled to be dismantled 20 years after the 1889 fair, but its usefulness in telegraphy led to those plans being scrapped.\n\nChicago, 1893: World’s Columbian Exposition Chicago’s 1893 fair was nicknamed the “Columbian Exposition” to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s voyages to the “New World.” A massive pool representing Columbus’s voyage served as its centerpiece. Other debuts at the fair included the first Ferris Wheel, the first chocolate brownies, and the first “squished penny” souvenirs. The event is also associated with multiple controversies. Chicago mayor Carter Harrison was assassinated during its final days, leading to the cancellation of the closing ceremony. Additionally, serial killer H. H. Holmes and his so-called “Murder Castle” are often tied to the fair, though their actual connection is likely minimal. Both the fair and the associated crimes are detailed in Erik Larson’s book The Devil in the White City.\n\nSt. Louis, 1904: Louisiana Purchase Exposition The 1904 World’s Fair was held to honor the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase. It saw the debut of the X-ray machine and inspired the popular song “Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis.” The fair featured daily re-enactments of battles from the Second Boer War, many of which featured people who had actually fought in it. The 1904 Summer Olympics had been awarded to Chicago but were re-located to St. Louis so they could be held alongside the fair. That change led to very sparse attendance and poorly run events over the course of several months. Novelist Kate Chopin suffered a brain hemorrhage while visiting the 1904 fair and died two days later.\n\nBrussels, 1958 The first full-scale world’s fair after World War II was held in Brussels in 1958. A lasting symbol of the Brussels fair is the Atomium, a 335-foot model of a unit cell of an iron crystal. The structure, which remains among the city’s most popular attractions, is approximately 165 billion times larger than the cell it represents. The fair also featured the Poème électronique, a piece of electronic music by Edgard Varèse played in a specialized pavilion designed by Le Corbusier. The first universal poll to rank the greatest films was held at the Brussels fair, which was topped by Sergei Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin.\n\nSeattle, 1962: Century 21 Because of the ongoing space race, Seattle’s fair had a strong focus on technology and aerospace. Structures built for the fair include the Space Needle and a monorail, both of which are still standing today. Its “World of Science” building housed the Project Mercury capsule that took Alan Shepard to space, and its “World of Century 21” building offered glimpses of “the future” of cities, cars, and air travel. John F. Kennedy intended to attend the closing of the fair, but was unable to because of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The fairgrounds, now known as the Seattle Center, has since become home to the Museum of Pop Culture.\n\nNew York, 1964 Like the Seattle fair two years earlier, the New York fair was themed around the burgeoning Space Age, particularly with the Unisphere, a massive stainless-steel globe that served as a key symbol of the event. Pope John XXIII allowed Michelangelo’s Pietà to be relocated to the fair’s Vatican Pavilion. Elsewhere, Walt Disney designed several animatronic attractions for the fair, including his first incarnation of the “It’s a Small World” ride. While it is generally named for 1964, the fair had a second “season” the following year as well. A pair of observation towers left over from the fair provide a key plot point to the movie Men in Black.\n\nMontreal, 1967: Expo 67 Montreal hosted one of the biggest world fairs in history and attracted over half a million visitors just days after opening. One highlight of the fair was the unveiling of Moshe Safdie’s “Habitat 67,” a complex of hundreds of interlocking concrete buildings intended as a model community. The U.S. Pavilion at the fair was a geodesic dome designed by Buckminster Fuller, which was later converted into a museum called the Biosphere. In a notorious moment, French president Charles de Gaulle addressed a crowd in Montreal and declared “Long live a free Quebec!,” angering many Canadian politicians.\n\nKnoxville, 1982 In contrast to larger “World Expos,” Knoxville held a “specialized” fair focused on energy. Structures built for the event include the Sunsphere, a 266-foot tower topped with a golden sphere. The fair also featured the debut of an early version of the touch screen and the introduction of Cherry Coke. American sports were also featured during the event, with the NFL and NBA both hosting exhibition games at local venues. A fictional version of the Sunsphere had a prominent role in an episode of The Simpsons, in which it was converted into the “Wigsphere,” a shop for discount wigs.\n\nDubai, 2020 The most recent world fair was scheduled for Dubai in 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it ultimately began in September 2021. The U.S. built a 36,000-square-foot pavilion for the fair, which featured artifacts like Thomas Jefferson’s copy of the Qur’an and a moon rock from the Apollo 17 mission. The fair also played host to the 2021 World Chess Championship, which was won by defending champion Magnus Carlsen. Shortly before the fair began, the European Parliament formally opposed the event, citing the UAE’s human rights record, though it had little effect on attendance."

    "title": "Black American Legislators",
    "content": "Hiram Revels (1827–1901) was a U.S. senator from Mississippi from 1870–1871. Revels, who was born free in North Carolina, was of mixed ancestry; he was both the first person with Black ancestry, and the first person with Native American ancestry, to serve in Congress. He was not popularly elected (the 17th Amendment had not yet been passed); rather, he was chosen by the Mississippi state senate. Democrats objected to Revels (a Republican) being seated; they claimed that since the 14th Amendment had only been ratified in 1868, Revels had only been a citizen for two years, not the nine years required to serve in the Senate. As a senator, Revels successfully argued that Georgia should not be readmitted to the Union until it allowed Black persons to serve in its state legislature. After his time in the senate, Revels served as the first president of what is now Alcorn State University, America’s first land-grant HBCU.\n\nP. B. S. Pinchback (1837–1921) was the first Black governor in U.S. history, serving briefly as governor of Louisiana from 1872–1873. Pinchback was the son of a white slaveowner and a freed slave. After becoming a state senator in 1868, he was appointed lieutenant governor in 1871 after Lieutenant Governor Oscar Dunn (also a Black man) died in office. When Governor Henry Clay Warmoth was impeached in December 1872, Pinchback became acting governor through the end of Warmoth’s term in January 1873. Although Pinchback was selected as a U.S. senator in 1872, Louisiana’s white Democrats effectively blocked him from ever taking his seat. After leaving politics, Pinchback became an active member of the Comité des Citoyens, a group of New Orleans citizens who organized Homer Plessy’s challenge to Louisiana’s segregated transportation laws, leading to the Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nEdward Brooke III (1919–2015) was the Massachusetts Attorney General from 1963–1967 and a U.S. senator from Massachusetts from 1967–1979. He was the first Black state attorney general and the first popularly-elected Black U.S. senator. Brooke was a moderate Republican who was often criticized for his opposition to protest movements and activists; in one speech, he controversially grouped Lester Maddox with Stokely Carmichael as “extremists of White Power and Black Power.” Brooke co-authored the Fair Housing Act of 1968 with Minnesota Democrat Walter Mondale. Brooke was the first Senate Republican to call for Richard Nixon’s resignation during Watergate.\n\nShirley Chisholm (1924–2005), who represented part of Brooklyn in the U.S. House from 1969–1983, was the first Black woman elected to Congress. She used the slogan “Unbought and Unbossed,” which was also the title of her first autobiography. Chisholm was a founding member of both the Congressional Black Caucus (in 1971) and the Congressional Women’s Caucus (in 1977). Chisholm spearheaded a 1975 bill that expanded the federal school lunch program. In 1972, Chisholm ran for the Democratic nomination for president, becoming the first Black candidate and first woman candidate for the nomination; she received 152 delegates at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. During the primary campaign, she visited segregationist candidate George Wallace in the hospital after he was shot.\n\nAndrew Young Jr. (1932–) served as a U.S. representative from Georgia from 1973–1977. Young was the executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference when Martin Luther King Jr. was the group’s president; Young is one of the men shown pointing in the direction of the shot in the notable photo taken moments after King’s assassination in 1968. In 1977 Jimmy Carter appointed Young as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; Young’s tenure in that role ended following a controversy in which he met with a representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Young served as mayor of Atlanta from 1982–1990 and was the co-chair of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.\n\nJohn Lewis (1940–2020) represented Georgia in the U.S. House from 1987 until his death in 2020. Lewis was a leader of the civil rights movement: he was one of the original Freedom Riders, served as the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and was one of the “Big Six” organizers of the 1963 March on Washington. Lewis worked with Hosea Williams to organize the first Selma-to-Montgomery march for voting rights, which was brutally stopped by Alabama State Troopers, who attacked the marchers and fractured Lewis’s skull after the marchers passed over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. In 2016, Lewis was among the House Democrats who led a sit-in protest in the House chamber demanding action on gun-control legislation. Shortly before Lewis’s 2020 death, he wrote a brief essay noting “Together, you can redeem the soul of our nation.”\n\nCarol Moseley Braun (1947–) was a U.S. senator from Illinois from 1993–1999. She was the second popularly-elected Black U.S. senator (after Brooke), making her the first Black woman and the first Black Democrat elected to the Senate. Before becoming a senator, Moseley Braun was a state representative and Cook County Recorder of Deeds. In the Senate, Moseley Braun and Maryland senator Barbara Mikulski successfully challenged a policy stating that women could not wear pants on the Senate floor. Moseley Braun controversially met with and subsequently defended the actions of Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha. Moseley Braun lost her 1998 re-election bid; she ran unsuccessfully in the 2004 Democratic presidential primary.\n\nBarack Obama (1961–) was a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005–2008 and was the U.S. president from 2009–2017. Obama rose to national prominence in 2004, while an Illinois state senator and candidate for the U.S. Senate; in that year, he gave a fiery keynote address at the Democratic National Convention titled “The Audacity of Hope,” which later became the title of his second book, after his 1995 memoir Dreams from My Father. Obama defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary, then—with running mate Joe Biden—beat Republican candidate John McCain in the 2008 presidential election during the Great Recession. Among the signature legislation passed during the Obama administration was the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, the latter of which overhauled financial regulations and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nKamala Harris (1964–) served as California’s attorney general from 2011–2017 and as a U.S. senator from California from 2017–2021. After dropping out of the 2020 Democractic primary, Harris was selected as Joe Biden’s running mate in the 2020 presidential election; Harris subsequently became the first Black person, first Asian-American person, and first woman to be vice president in U.S. history. Prior to Harris, two other women (Geraldine Ferraro and Sarah Palin) had been unsuccessful vice presidential nominees. Harris began her political career by defeating incumbent Terence Hallinan in 2003 to become San Francisco’s district attorney. During her time as California’s attorney general, she continued her predecessor Jerry Brown’s policy of refusing to defend Proposition 8 (California’s ban on gay marriage) in court; Harris later officiated at the wedding of Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, parties to the Supreme Court case Hollingsworth v. Perry. Harris’s father is from Jamaica; her mother is from India.\n\nCory Booker (1969–) was the mayor of Newark, New Jersey from 2006–2013 and has been a U.S. senator from New Jersey since 2013. Booker’s first (unsuccessful) campaign for the Newark mayorship, in 2002, was chronicled in the Oscar-nominated documentary Street Fight. While Booker was mayor of Newark, Mark Zuckerberg donated $100 million to Newark’s schools. When U.S. senator Frank Lautenberg died in 2013, Booker won a special election to fill Lautenberg’s seat, then kept the seat in the 2014 regular election. In the Senate, Booker was part of a coalition that supported the 2018 First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill. Booker ran unsuccessfully in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary."

    "title": "Supreme Court Cases Concerned With African-americans",
    "content": "Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) determined that people of African ancestry did not have the rights of citizens in the United States. Dred Scott was a slave who had been taken to Illinois and free parts of the Louisiana Territory before being brought back to Missouri, and claimed that being brought to free territory made him free. Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that African-Americans were not citizens and thus did not have the right to bring a lawsuit in federal court. Taney’s ruling further found that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional under the Property Clause. President James Buchanan supported the Court’s decision in the case, which was delivered two days after his inauguration. This ruling was later overturned by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nPlessy v. Ferguson (1896) determined that state-imposed segregation was legal. Homer Plessy was seven-eighths white, but he was not allowed on a whites-only car on a Louisiana train. He claimed that forced segregation violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to “equal protection of the laws.” Justice Henry Brown wrote that segregation was acceptable as long as there was no clear difference in quality between the railway cars, which is often referred to with the phrase “separate but equal.” Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter in the 8–1 decision; in his dissenting opinion, he stated “[o]ur Constitution is color-blind.” Plessy was effectively overturned by Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nPowell v. Alabama (1932) determined that defendants must be given legal counsel in a way that gives counsel enough time to do their job. This case was brought by nine young African-Americans, known as the Scottsboro Boys, eight of whom had been covincted of rape and sentenced to death. The Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause required states—in cases where the death penalty was a possibility—to inform defendants that they had a right to counsel, to appoint an attorney to represent defendants who could not afford one, and to do so in a manner that allowed the appointed attorney adequate time to prepare a defense (a requirement later expanded in Gideon v. Wainwright). Eventually, the rape victims recanted their story; some of the defendants were convicted anyways. Three years after ruling in Powell, the Court ruled in the related case of Norris v. Alabama (1935) that Black people could not be systematically excluded from juries.\n\nShelley v. Kraemer (1948) determined that racially restrictive housing covenants could not be enforced by courts. Louis Kraemer was a white person in a white neighborhood in St. Louis that did not allow residents to sell their houses to African-Americans or Asian-Americans. The Shelleys were an African-American family that bought a house in the neighborhood. Chief Justice Fred Vinson determined that any state action enforcing the covenant would be discriminatory, and would therefore violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was decided 6–0, with three justices recusing themselves because they had racially restrictive housing covenants for their own houses. The creation of racially restrictive housing covenants was outlawed by the Fair Housing Act of 1968. An important precursor to the Shelley decision was the 1940 case Hansberry v. Lee, brought by the father of Lorraine Hansberry, the author of A Raisin in the Sun.\n\nBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954) determined that racially segregated schools were unconstitutional. Brown was actually only one of a set of consolidated cases brought by African-Americans in multiple states, all of which were decided along with Brown. In all of those cases, African-Americans were turned down when they tried to enroll their children in white-only schools. Thurgood Marshall, who later became the first Black Supreme Court justice, argued the case for the families. Though many lower courts ruled for the schools, based on the “separate but equal” doctrine established in Plessy, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote a unanimous decision stating that segregated schools are inherently unequal and therefore a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In a ruling the next year, the Supreme Court determined that school integration should occur “with all deliberate speed.” This inexact wording led many districts in the South to stall the implementation of integration as long as possible.\n\nBailey v. Patterson (1962) determined that African-Americans had the right to nonsegregated transportation services. This case was brought after the arrest of the Freedom Riders, who went to the South in 1961 to protest continuing segregation. Sam Bailey was an African-American civil rights activist who worked with Medgar Evers, and Joe Patterson was the Attorney General of Mississippi. The Supreme Court ruled per curiam that transportation services should already be unsegregated according to the law (calling the question “so well settled that it is foreclosed as a litigable issue”) and that the federal judiciary in Mississippi should enforce this.\n\nHeart of Atlanta Motel v. United States (1964) determined that the United States could end racial discrimination in public accommodations. As soon as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, Moreton Rolleston Jr. filed a lawsuit claiming that he was allowed to prevent African-Americans from staying at his motel. The Supreme Court decided unanimously that the Commerce Clause in Article I of the Constitution allowed the federal government to desegregate hotels and motels because those businesses are impacted by interstate travel, as part of a judicial trend over the 20th century which widened the scope of the Commerce Clause. The plot of land where the Heart of Atlanta Motel once stood is now occupied by the Atlanta Hilton.\n\nLoving v. Virginia (1967) determined that states could not ban interracial marriages, striking down anti-miscegenation laws. Richard Loving, a white man, married Mildred Jeter, who was African-American, in Washington, D.C. When the couple moved to Virginia, they were in violation of the state’s Racial Integrity Act of 1924, and they were told they would either have to spend a year in prison or leave the state. When that decision was upheld by the Virginia Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the Virginia law violated the Fourteenth Amendment, as its only purpose was racial discrimination. The couple remained married and in Virginia. Richard Loving was killed by a drunk driver in 1975. Mildred Loving died in 2008; the year before her death, she issued a statement of support for extending the ruling in Loving to allow same-sex couples to wed, as well.\n\nRegents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) determined that public systems could take race into account, but could not set specific racial quotas, in determining who, to admit to a university, thus upholding affirmative action. Allan Bakke was a white person who was rejected from the University of California Medical School at Davis. The medical school set aside sixteen positions each year for minorities, and Bakke contended that he was more qualified than the minorities. The decision was confusing, with Justice Lewis Powell being the only justice who was both for using race as a criterion and against quotas. Four other justices supported the use of quotas, and the remaining four were against all affirmative action. Bakke was admitted to the medical school; he eventually became an anesthesiologist in Minnesota.\n\nGrutter v. Bollinger (2003) determined that affirmative action programs whose purpose is to increase diversity are legal. Barbara Grutter was a white applicant to the University of Michigan Law School who was denied, and Lee Bollinger was the university president. On the same day, the Supreme Court ruled on Gratz v. Bollinger, which addressed undergraduate admissions at Michigan. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that the undergraduate affirmative action program was unconstitutional because it was based on a point system rather than a holistic look at applicants. Together, these decisions were viewed as upholding the Bakke decision made earlier. These cases were later strengthened by two Fisher v. University of Texas cases, in 2013 and 2016. At the time of Grutter, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor remarked “We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest [in student body diversity] approved today.”"

    "title": "Programming Terms",
    "content": "An algorithm is a set of detailed instructions for solving a problem, such as “sort a list” or “divide two numbers.” Algorithms can be described in human language, a programming language, or in other ways, but they are written in detail to explain how to handle all possible inputs (e.g., the list to sort or the numbers to divide) or fail if the task is impossible (e.g., if dividing two numbers and the second is 0). The word “algorithm” derives from the name of Al-Khwarizmi, a Persian scholar also credited with some of the most fundamental principles in algebra. Computer scientists analyze how many steps algorithms need (time complexity) and how much memory they need for temporary storage of intermediate results (space complexity). The worst-case situations are expressed using big O notation; for example, if an algorithm to sort a list of n items might need up to n2 to sort the list, the algorithm’s worst-case time complexity is O(n2). (This is a simplification of the mathematics of asymptotic notation.)\n\nRecursion is a technique used in some algorithms. Sometimes an algorithm calls itself to solve a smaller case of the problem, until it reaches a simple base case that is already solved. For example, a recursive algorithm to calculate n factorial uses the fact that n! = n·(n−1)!, so it calls itself on n−1 and keeps going with smaller values until it reaches the base case of 1!, which is just 1. Tail recursion is the use of recursion as the last step of an algorithm. Algorithms that use tail recursion are often more optimized by compilers. Recursive algorithms can have their big O runtime calculated by the Master theorem.\n\nA graph is a mathematical concept often used in algorithms, in which a set of vertices is connected by a set of edges. In visual representations, the vertices are shown as dots, with edges shown as lines between the two vertices they connect. A path between two vertices is a sequence of edges that starts at the first vertex and ends at the last. A cycle is a path that begins and ends at the same vertex. A graph is called weighted if every edge has a number representing the “cost” of traveling the edge; weighted graphs are used, for example, in analyzing navigation, with vertices representing cities, edges representing roads between them, and weights representing distance (or travel time). A graph is called directed if each edge has an inherent direction (an edge going from vertex A to vertex B, but not from B to A), e.g., representing a one-way road Graphs are also called networks, and this is the origin of the term social network: if vertices represent people and edges represent who knows whom, a social network is a graph of a collection of people and the relationships between them. Graphs are used to organize data (often in trees, which are graphs in which you can reach any vertex from any other vertex, but there are no cycles), analyze navigation/travel (broadly construed, such as the flow of fluid in a complex pipe system), manage tasks and scheduling (with edges representing dependencies), and more. Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two vertices of a graph (possibly a weighted graph, in which case “shortest” means least total weight). Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm are used to find a graph’s minimum spanning tree, that is a tree connecting all its vertices whose edges have the smallest possible total weight.\n\nDivide-and-conquer algorithms use recursion to split problems into smaller subproblems with smaller input sets. By solving the same problem on each of these subproblems, then combining the outputs in some way, a divide-and-conquer algorithm can efficiently solve problems on big input sets. Merge sort (a sorting algorithm), binary search (an algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list), and Karatsuba’s algorithm (an algorithm for multiplying integers) are examples of divide-and-conquer algorithms.\n\nGreedy algorithms are algorithms that make the locally optimum or “best” choice at every step. Such algorithms may or may not produce an overall best solution. Consider an algorithm for making change in which you pick the largest coin smaller than or equal to the amount of change you need to give. If you need to give 7¢ change, you first pick a nickel (5¢) and still have to make 2¢ change, so you pick a penny (1¢) and still have to make 1¢, so you add an additional penny and have broken the 7¢ into 5¢ + 1¢ + 1¢. In the U.S. coin system, this is optimal in the sense of using as few coins as possible, namely three coins. However, in a coin system that offered coins worth 1¢, 3¢, 4¢, and 5¢, the greedy algorithm would give the same solution, even though a solution with fewer coins is possible (4¢ + 3¢).\n\nA programming language is a way to write algorithms and other instructions in a way that can (usually after additional steps) be understood and executed by a computer. Almost all programming languages have ways of defining variables, which hold data, and functions, which are sets of instructions that achieve some task (such as performing an algorithm). Java, JavaScript (which is not the same as Java), C, C++, and Python are common programming languages. Programming languages can be categorized by their paradigm (which is a general sense of how the code tends to be structured), typing (see below), how they are run (compiled or interpreted), and in other ways.\n\nObject-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that involves the creation of objects from classes that can hold data and transform it in various ways. A class is a definition of the fundamental properties than an object has, while objects are specific examples of a class (for instance, the general idea of a dog is a class, while your pet dog would be an object.) Inheritance allows subclasses to be defined so that the properties of a parent class are present in the sub-class (for example, “schnauzer” might be a subclass of “dog”). In composition, an object contains or references another object (which might or might not be of the same class, e.g., a dog’s digestive system might be another object). Object-oriented programming also often uses encapsulation to hide unnecessary details from other aspects, e.g., a dog’s digestive system doesn’t need to know about its circulatory system. Polymorphism is the idea that different classes may be able to do the same things in potentially different ways, e.g., animals all eat but they do so in different ways. Java and C++ are object-oriented languages.\n\nFunctional programming is a paradigm based on the execution of various functions to calculate values. Functions in pure functional programming are free of side effects, meaning that they do not change the program state but only compute values. Functional languages use currying to evaluate functions with multiple inputs. ML and Haskell are functional programming languages.\n\nA compiler is used with many programming languages to convert human-readable code into instructions that a machine can execute. C and C++ programs are often compiled by GCC into code specific for the machine the compiler is running on. Java’s compiler instead compiles into a less specific format called bytecode, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Since compiled Java can be run on any machine with a JVM, Java is referred to as “write once, run anywhere.” Some languages are not compiled before running but instead have their code turned into machine instructions as they run, such as JavaScript and Python; these languages are called interpreted.\n\nA language’s typing refers to how the type of data a variable holds is defined and can or can’t change. Common types of variables are booleans, which can only be true or false; strings, which hold text; integers; and floats and doubles, which hold non-integer numbers. In statically typed languages, a variable is given a type the first time it is used and can’t be changed; compilers check that all variables have the correct types while the program is compiling, which helps catch errors but also makes some tasks more difficult. Java, C, and C++ have static typing. Dynamically typed languages do not check types when compiling, which makes some tasks easier, but type errors (e.g., trying to multiply two strings) can occur while the program is running. Python and JavaScript are dynamically typed. Some languages support duck typing, which is sort of intermediate between static and dynamic typing. Duck typing essentially allows objects to do the same or similar things even if their classes have no formal relation. For example, airplanes and birds might both have a “fly” capability even though neither is a subclass of the other (or otherwise related)."

    "title": "Pre-1960s Movies",
    "content": "The Wizard of Oz (1939) is an MGM adaptation of L. Frank Baum’s children’s book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The cast includes Frank Morgan as the title wizard, Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, and Judy Garland as the protagonist, Dorothy Gale, who, with her dog Toto, is whisked from Kansas to the mystical land of Oz by a tornado. The Wizard of Oz was one of the first films to use three-strip Technicolor, although the credits and the framing sequences set in Kansas were filmed in sepia-toned black-and-white. The film won two Oscars, including Best Original Song for “Over the Rainbow,” but lost the Best Picture award to Gone With the Wind.\n\nGone With the Wind (1939) is an adaptation of Margaret Mitchell’s 1936 novel of the same name. The film was produced by David O. Selznick and directed by Victor Fleming, who had just directed The Wizard of Oz. Gone With the Wind is set during the Civil War on the Georgia plantation of Tara and stars Vivien Leigh in an Oscar-winning role as Scarlett O’Hara, who marries Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) despite pining after the married Ashley Wilkes. Near the end of the film, Scarlett suffers a miscarriage after a fight with Rhett, who then leaves her; when Scarlett asks him, “Where shall I go? What shall I do?” he famously responds “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.”\n\nFantasia (1940) is a Walt Disney animated film consisting of eight animated story segments overlaid with classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski and performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Fantasia’s soundtrack, which includes Toccata and Fugue in D Minor and The Rite of Spring, was the first to be produced in stereoscopic sound (i.e., “in stereo”). The marquee segment of Fantasia is The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, in which Mickey Mouse magically summons a horde of dancing brooms in the castle of the wizard Yen Sid (“Disney” spelled backwards). A portion of Fantasia in which a black centaur buffs the hooves of a white centaur was edited out in 1969 before the film’s re-release. A sequel, Fantasia 2000, was released in 1999.\n\nCitizen Kane (1941), directed by Orson Welles, is considered by many (including the American Film Institute) to be the greatest film ever made. Through flashbacks, it tells the story of fictional publishing mogul Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles and loosely based on real-life newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst), who buys the New York Inquirer, unsuccessfully runs for governor of New York, and tries to make his second wife an opera star before dying at his Florida estate, Xanadu. In the present day, reporter Jerry Thompson fruitlessly attempts to discover the meaning of Kane’s dying word, “Rosebud,” which turns out to be the brand name of Kane’s beloved childhood sled, an object burned by unsuspecting servants as the film ends.\n\nCasablanca (1942) stars Humphrey Bogart as American expatriate Rick Blaine living in Vichy-controlled Morocco during World War II. The film opens with Ugarte, a local criminal, attempting to sell “letters of transit” at Rick’s nightclub, Rick’s Café Américain. Ingrid Bergman stars opposite Bogart as Rick’s former lover Ilsa Lund, whose current husband, an anti-Nazi resistance leader, needs the letters. In one memorable scene, Ilsa’s husband, Victor Laszlo, leads a crowd in singing “La Marseillaise” in response to a group of Nazis singing “Die Wacht am Rhein.” Famous quotes from Casablanca include “Round up the usual suspects,” “Here’s looking at you, kid,” and “Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Life (1946) is a Christmas drama produced and directed by Frank Capra based on Philip Van Doren Stern’s short story “The Greatest Gift.” Set in the fictional town of Bedford Falls, It’s a Wonderful Life stars Jimmy Stewart as building and loan operator George Bailey, who plans to commit suicide on Christmas Eve over a financial disaster caused by the villainous Henry Potter. A guardian angel, Clarence Odbody (played by Henry Travers), stops George from killing himself by showing him what his hometown would be like had he never been born: for example, George would not have been able to save his younger brother from drowning in a frozen lake, or prevent the town pharmacist from accidentally poisoning a prescription.\n\nRashomon (1950) is an Akira Kurosawa film based on Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s 1922 short story “In a Grove” (not his story “Rashomon”). The film depicts a trial in which a bandit (Tajomaru), a woodcutter (Kikori), a samurai (through a medium), and the samurai’s wife recount the events that led to the samurai’s death. A common thread through the four stories is the presence of an expensive dagger no longer at the crime scene. The marked differences in the characters’ stories, however, led to the term “Rashomon effect” to describe the unreliability of eyewitnesses. During the woodcutter’s testimony, the group is interrupted by the cries of an abandoned baby, a crisis that reveals some insights into the characters.\n\n12 Angry Men (1957) explores themes of morals, justice, and doubt as it follows the deliberations of a jury over the guilt of an 18-year-old defendant on a charge of patricide. Deliberations initially stall when Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda, is the only one to vote “not guilty”; a series of secret ballots and conversations gradually erode the jury’s certainty, and they ultimately vote to acquit. The last holdout, Juror 3, played by Lee Cobb, is implied to be locked into his “guilty” vote because of his anger over his poor relationship with his own son. The film, directed by Sidney Lumet, lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to Bridge on the River Kwai.\n\nBen-Hur (1959) is a historical epic from MGM Studios that stars Charlton Heston as the title prince of Jerusalem who is unjustly imprisoned on the flagship of Roman general Quintus Arrius after tiles falling from his roof nearly kill the governor of Judea. Ben-Hur features a massive, nine-minute-long chariot race in which Heston’s character defeats Messala, played by Stephen Boyd. The film’s score, composed by Miklós Rózsa, is the longest ever composed for a feature film. Ben-Hur’s eleven Oscars was a record that stood until Titanic (1997). More than 200 camels were used in the film, which was adapted from Lew Wallace’s novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.\n\nNorth by Northwest (1959) is a thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock starring Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive framed for the murder of U.N. diplomat Lester Townsend. In one memorable and oft-parodied scene, Thornhill is chased through a field near Chicago by a crop duster airplane. At the film’s climax, Thornhill and Eve Kendall (played by Eva Marie Saint) are chased by spies led by Phillip Vandamm across the top of Mount Rushmore. North by Northwest features a MacGuffin (an object common in Hitchcock films—something desired by characters yet ultimately meaningless to the story) in the form of microfilm containing government secrets that is hidden inside a sculpture."

    "content": "The Iroquois Confederacy originally consisted of five tribes native to upstate New York: the Mohawk, Cayuga, Oneida, Seneca, and Onondaga. The confederacy was founded based on the teachings of a prophet called the Great Peacemaker, whose followers included chief Hiawatha, the subject of a famous poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The confederacy gradually expanded to control much of the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic regions and also incorporated the Tuscarora people, who migrated from North Carolina after defeat in a colonial war. In the Beaver Wars, the Iroquois and their British allies came to dominate various Algonquin peoples allied with the French. The Iroquois Confederacy collapsed after the American Revolution, during which leaders like Joseph Brant stood by the British.\n\nThe Powhatan are an Algonquin-speaking people who lived in eastern Virginia when the English colony of Jamestown was founded in 1607. Led by their namesake, Chief Powhatan, the tribe maintained a tenuous relationship with colonists at Jamestown. Legendarily, John Smith was captured by the Powhatan and was only spared by the intercession of his daughter, Pocahontas. The Powhatan were decimated by disease and enslavement by the mid-1600s; by the time Thomas Jefferson profiled the tribe in his Notes on the State of Virginia, they numbered only 300.\n\nThe Cherokee people lived as one of the so-called “Five Civilized Tribes” of the southeastern United States, along with the Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminoles. In the early 1800s, the Cherokee adopted many American cultural practices, from settled agriculture and representative government to an original alphabet created by Sequoyah. Though their sovereignty was acknowledged in the case Worcester v. Georgia, the Cherokee were still driven west along the Trail of Tears after some members signed the Treaty of New Echota. Today, the Cherokee are the largest federally-recognized Native American tribe.\n\nThe Seminole, another “civilized tribe,” lived in what is now Florida and fought multiple wars against the U.S. to resist attempts to force them to move west. In the First Seminole War, Andrew Jackson invaded Spanish-controlled Florida and pushed the Seminoles out of the state’s northern region. Twenty years later, Seminole leaders like Osceola resisted removal in the Second Seminole War but were eventually driven to Oklahoma under the terms of the Treaty of Payne’s Landing. In the 1850s, Billy Bowlegs led Seminoles who remained in Florida in yet another war against American expansion, but he too was defeated.\n\nThe Shawnee people are native to the Ohio Valley. Their leader Blue Jacket allied with the Miami people to crush an American incursion into the region at the Battle of the Wabash in 1791. Later, the charismatic Shawnee leader Tecumseh and his visionary brother Tenkswatawa, also known as “the Prophet,” built a coalition of tribes to oppose U.S. expansion. After losing at Tippecanoe to William Henry Harrison, the Shawnee allied with the British in the War of 1812 and helped them take Detroit. However, their coalition collapsed after the death of Tecumseh at the Battle of the Thames.\n\nThe Lakota Sioux were the preeminent tribe of the northern Great Plains for most of the 19th century. They drove smaller tribes out of the Black Hills and had their territory recognized by the United States in two Treaties of Fort Laramie. When American prospectors invaded the Black Hills, the Sioux fought back. With their allies the Cheyenne and Arapaho, the Sioux—led by Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse—wiped out a U.S. cavalry force led by George Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Later, in the 1890s, a religious movement called the Ghost Dance spread among the Sioux. While trying to suppress it, U.S. forces slaughtered Sioux civilians in the Wounded Knee massacre.\n\nThe Shoshone people also held lands on the northern plains, while their linguistic relatives the Comanche dominated the southern plains. Sacagawea, a member of the Shoshone, served as an interpreter and guide for Lewis and Clark’s Corps of Discovery. The tribe was later devastated by such attacks as the Bear River massacre and driven from their lands by white settlers. In an attempt to secure aid, the chief Pocatello led a mass conversion of Shoshone to Mormonism in 1875.\n\nThe Nez Perce people lived along the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest and maintained friendly relationships with Americans through most of the 19th century. When the U.S. attempted to remove them from their lands, however, the Nez Perce fought back, embarking on a 1,200-mile retreat that ended only when they were trapped just south of the Canadian border. In a speech, the Nez Perce leader Chief Joseph then declared “I will fight no more forever.” He and the Nez Perce were subsequently deported to Kansas.\n\nThe Apache people live in the American southwest and contested land claims with both Mexican and American settlers, having earlier gained a reputation for ferocity by raiding other tribes in the southwest for generations. A federal attempt to seize the Apache chief Cochise in 1861 led to a series of decades-long clashes with the U.S. government. One Apache leader, Geronimo, repeatedly broke out of reservations and fought American forces until he was eventually captured by Nelson Miles and exiled to Florida.\n\nThe Navajo people are also indigenous to the American southwest. After their homeland was devastated in a campaign led by Kit Carson (the namesake of Carson City, Nevada) the Navajo were driven from Arizona to New Mexico in the Long Walk to Bosque Redondo. During World War II, Navajo “code-talkers” used their native language to securely transmit messages across the Pacific theater of the war. Today, the Navajo are the second-largest federally-recognized tribe and administer the Four Corners Monument."

    "content": "DNA polymerases catalyze the synthesis of DNA from a DNA template, particularly during DNA replication (in which one DNA molecule makes two identical copies, typically during the S phase of the cell cycle). The polymerase reacts a growing DNA strand with a nucleoside triphosphate (ATP, GTP, CTP, and TTP), resulting in a DNA strand one base longer and an ion of pyrophosphate (P2 O74−). There are several enzymes in the DNA polymerase family: DNA Polymerase I (or Pol I) participates in DNA replication in prokaryotes; it was discovered by Arthur Kornberg in E. coli. In eukaryotic cells, DNA polymerases α, δ, and ε (alpha, delta, and epsilon) are the polymerases most involved in nuclear DNA replication. DNA polymerases synthesize new DNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction, but they also possess a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity to fix mistakes made during replication (a process called proofreading). DNA polymerases can quickly add nucleotides to a DNA strand because of their ability to slide along a template without slipping off, a characteristic known as processivity. Taq polymerase, a specific DNA polymerase from the bacteria Thermus aquaticus, is stable at high temperatures and is thus used in polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) in molecular biology laboratories.\n\nRNA polymerase catalyzes the formation of single-stranded RNA from a DNA template. In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II is the member of the RNA polymerase family that synthesizes precursors of mRNA during transcription. In prokaryotes, RNA polymerase is bound to a sigma factor, which binds to the core promoter region in which transcription is initiated. In eukaryotes, the function of the sigma factor is performed by a group of proteins called general transcription factors, which associate with RNA polymerase to form the transcription preinitiation complex. The RNA polymerase complex (known as a holoenzyme) then switches from a closed complex to an open one, unwinding a portion of DNA to form the transcription bubble. Early on during RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must escape the promoter; if it fails to do so, short RNA transcripts are generated in a process called abortive initiation.\n\nReverse transcriptase catalyzes the formation of complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template. It is used by retroviruses such as HIV in order to replicate their genomes; a class of anti-HIV drugs known as reverse transcriptase inhibitors (including AZT) interfere with the function of the enzyme. Reverse transcriptase is also used by retrotransposons, which are genomic DNA sequences that copy and paste themselves into different locations using an RNA intermediate. In the laboratory, reverse transcriptase is used in RT-PCR, a variant of the polymerase chain reaction that aims to measure the expression levels of different genes.\n\nTelomerase adds a repeat sequence called a telomere to the end of chromosomes; telomeres shorten during each round of cell division, a phenomenon that is correlated with cellular aging (senescence). The telomerase complex contains a subunit called TERT, a reverse transcriptase enzyme that carries its own RNA molecule, which it uses as a template to add the six-nucleotide repeating sequence TTAGGG to the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity is regulated by shelterin, a protein complex that protects telomeres.\n\nRubisco (sometimes capitalized RuBisCO, short for Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is an enzyme involved in the light-independent/dark reactions of photosynthesis, part of a pathway known as the Calvin cycle. The enzyme catalyzes the carboxylation (addition of C O2) of RuBP to form two molecules of glycerate-3-phosphate (G3P, or 3-PGA). However, oxygen (O2) can compete with C O2 for binding to Rubisco, resulting in an energy-wasteful side reaction called photorespiration. By some estimates, Rubisco is the most abundant enzyme on Earth.\n\nCatalase decomposes hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. It is found in virtually every organism that is exposed to oxygen, and is crucial for preventing cells from experiencing damage from reactive oxygen species (such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, the hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen, which can all damage DNA and participate in unwanted reactions with various proteins). In eukaryotic cells, catalase is localized to an organelle called the peroxisome. Catalase has an incredibly high turnover number (the number of chemical reactions that an enzyme can catalyze in one second): it can decompose millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules per second. In fact, it is so fast that it is termed catalytically perfect: its rate of reaction is so fast that the slowest process limiting its speed is the diffusion of molecules in and out of the active site. Microbiologists can identify bacteria that express catalase (which is most bacteria, with Streptococcus and Enterococcus as notable exceptions) via the catalase test: a drop of hydrogen peroxide is added to a microscope slide, and then a colony of bacteria is touched to it. If it bubbles, then the bacteria is catalase-positive.\n\nATP synthase catalyzes the formation of a molecule of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P O43−). ATP synthase is a molecular machine with two subunits: FO (‘O’ for “oligomycin,” which inhibits the enzyme) and F1, the latter of which rotates like a motor while producing ATP. ATP synthase is “powered” by a gradient of protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane or thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient, sometimes called the proton motive force, is generated by the action of the electron transport chain. Paul Boyer elucidated the mechanism of ATP synthase and John Walker crystallized the F1 domain (at the time the largest asymmetric protein structure known); the two shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work.\n\nAmylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch into simple sugars during digestion. It is present in the saliva of humans and other mammals, as well as in the pancreas (both of these forms of amylase are alpha-amylases). Amylase specifically cleaves the α-1,4-glycosidic bonds between glucose monomers in starch. Amylase was first isolated in 1833 by French chemists who called it “diastase,” establishing the use of “-ase” as a suffix in the names of enzymes.\n\nPepsin breaks down proteins into peptides and amino acids during digestion. Its precursor (proenzyme or zymogen) pepsinogen is produced by gastric chief cells in the stomach and is most active in the acidic environment of gastric acid (pH between 1.5 and 2.5). Like the other digestive enzymes chymotrypsin and trypsin, pepsin is an endopeptidase, meaning that it cuts internal peptide bonds within the protein.\n\nCas9 is an enzyme that is used in the CRISPR technique for gene editing. Native to Streptococcus pyogenes, Cas9 checks the spacer region of a guide RNA (gRNA) for any sites complementary to a piece of foreign DNA; if there are any such complementary sites, Cas9 cuts the foreign DNA. Cas9 thus functions like an “immune system” for bacteria, protecting them against bacteriophage DNA and DNA from foreign plasmids. By engineering guide RNAs with specific sequences, Cas9 can be used to cut DNA in specific locations, allowing for gene editing. Two residues in the RuvC and HNH domains of Cas9 can be mutated to alanine to generate a “dead” variant of Cas9 (dCas9), which has no cutting (endonuclease) activity; this variant has been used to study how Cas9 binds to DNA.\n\nRestriction enzymes (or restriction endonucleases) cut DNA into fragments at specific recognition sites, most of which are palindromic. The product of a restriction digest is either two strands of even length (a blunt end), or one strand that is slightly longer than the other (a sticky end). An example of a restriction enzyme that produces a blunt end is SmaI, whereas sticky ends are produced by the restriction enzyme EcoRI. Many binding sites for restriction enzymes are found on plasmids, which are often used during molecular cloning."

    "content": "Argos, a city-state or polis, was a major rival of Sparta. Both were on a large peninsula known as the Peloponnese. Argos came to prominence in the 7th century BC under King Pheidon, who is sometimes credited with developing the use of citizen-soldiers known as hoplites in rectangular phalanx formations.\n\nAthens is on the peninsula of Attica, across the Saronic Gulf from Corinth. Athens is often called the birthplace of democracy. Its political institutions included the ecclesia, an assembly open to all male citizens, which elected officials and enacted legislation; and the boule, a group of male citizens chosen by lot who served for a year at a time. The boule oversaw day-to-day operations of the government, and set the agenda for the ecclesia. The size of the boule and the functions of both assemblies changed due to constitutional reforms enacted by Solon, Cleisthenes, Ephialtes, and Pericles. The ecclesia could banish a citizen for ten years, a practice known as ostracism. The rise to power of Athens during the Persian Wars sparked the Peloponnesian War, which Athens lost.\n\nCorinth’s location—on the land route to the Peloponnese, and with a placement at the Isthmus of Corinth that allowed it to have harbors on the Saronic and Corinthian Gulfs—made it a major trade center. The tyrant Periander is credited with building the Diolkos, a four- to five-mile long paved track across the Isthmus that allowed transport of ships and heavy goods much faster than could be achieved by sailing all the way around the Peloponnese.\n\nDelphi was a sacred site on the Greek mainland, which the Greeks thought was the center of the world. A major temple to Apollo at Delphi housed the Oracle of Delphi, a priestess known as the Pythia (a title that commemorates Apollo’s slaying of the snake Python at Delphi). Every four years, Delphi hosted the Panhellenic Pythian Games, which were second only to the Olympic Games in importance.\n\nKnossos is an archaeological site on the island of Crete that contains remains from the Neolithic to the late Bronze Age. Knossos became the center of the Minoan civilization. In 1900 British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans began excavating its large palace complex, which yielded a large trove of tablets inscribed in Linear A (still undeciphered) and Linear B (shown to represent an ancient form of Greek, but written long before the development of the Greek alphabet).\n\nOlympia is on the Peloponnese. Like Delphi, Olympia was a major Panhellenic sacred site. The cult statue in its Temple of Zeus was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The site also had athletic facilities for the Olympic Games held every four years.\n\nSparta was for many years the predominant polis of the Peloponnese. Sparta was led by two kings, one each from the Agiad and Eurypontid families. The constitution of Lycurgus established the Gerousia, a council of elected elders plus the kings, which functioned as a high court and decided which matters to forward to the popular assembly, or apella (the analogue of the ecclesia of other city-states). The two kings were also joined by five annually elected ephors, who had broad executive powers. Sparta beat its rival Athens in the Peloponnesian War in the late 5th century BC, but lost its position as the leading military power in all of Greece to Thebes in 371 BC.\n\nSyracuse was a major Greek colony on Sicily, founded by colonists from Corinth and Tenea. Its forces crushed the Sicilian Expedition of Athens, which proved to be the decisive turning point of the Peloponnesian War. Some 200 years later, the great scientist Archimedes died during the Roman takeover of Syracuse.\n\nThebes was the main city of Boeotia, a region of the southern Greek mainland just west of Attica. Thebes allied with Sparta during the Peloponnesian War, but the two cities quickly became enemies following the war. Thebes established the Sacred Band, an elite force of 300 soldiers consisting of pairs of male lovers, and broke the hegemony of Sparta at the 371 BC Battle of Leuctra. However, Thebes fell from power quickly, fighting on the losing side at the 338 BC Battle of Chaeronea against the Macedonians led by Philip II, and the city was destroyed three years later by Alexander the Great following an unsuccessful revolt."

    "content": "Abraham (originally known as Abram) is the first patriarch in the Book of Genesis. Abraham, who was originally from Ur of the Chaldeans, is promised the land of Canaan, which he enters with his wife Sarah and his nephew Lot. To test Abraham’s faithfulness, the Lord orders him to sacrifice his son Isaac on Mount Moriah; Abraham complies, but at the last second, he is stopped by an angel and given a ram to sacrifice instead. Abraham then makes a covenant with the Lord, who promises that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore. In Islamic tradition, Abraham (known as Ibrahim) is instead told to sacrifice his son Ishmael, whose mother is the concubine Hagar. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are collectively known as Abrahamic religions due to Abraham’s central role in the scriptures of all three.\n\nJacob is the third and final patriarch in the Book of Genesis, the son of Isaac and Rebekah. In Isaac’s old age, he intends to bless Jacob’s elder twin brother Esau, but Jacob wears goatskins to impersonate his sibling and receives the blessing instead. While traveling to his uncle Laban to escape Esau’s wrath, he has a vision of angels moving up and down a ladder to heaven. After working for seven years, he is given Laban’s daughter Leah in marriage, but works another seven years to marry Laban’s daughter Rachel instead. His name is changed to Israel after he spends a night wrestling with an angel; the angel defeats him by striking his hip socket, which is why Jewish law forbids eating the sciatic muscle. Jacob’s sons become the heads of the Twelve Tribes of Israel; his son Joseph receives a coat of many colors, is sold into slavery by his brothers, and becomes vizier for the pharaoh of Egypt.\n\nMoses leads the Israelites during the Exodus, freeing them from their captivity in Egypt. He is abandoned in a basket as a child and is raised by the pharaoh’s daughter. After killing an Egyptian overseer, he flees to the land of Midian, where the Lord appears to him in a burning bush. Moses and his brother Aaron go before the pharaoh to request he release the Israelites from bondage. When the pharaoh refuses, the Lord afflicts Egypt with Ten Plagues, the last of which causes the death of every first-born male child. The Israelites avoid this by painting their doorposts with lamb’s blood, a ritual that leads to the establishment of the holiday of Passover. Moses then leads the Israelites out of Egypt by parting the Red Sea, after which they spend 40 years wandering in the desert. Moses receives the tablets of the Ten Commandments from the Lord on Mount Sinai, but smashes them in anger when he sees the people worshipping a golden calf. Moses dies before entering the Promised Land and is succeeded by Joshua as the leader of the Israelites. Since the books of the Jewish Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) are attributed to Moses, the rules set forth in the Torah are known as the Mosaic Law.\n\nSamson is the last of twelve namesake leaders of Israel in the Book of Judges. He possesses superhuman strength as he never cuts his hair. After falling in love with a Philistine woman and preparing to marry her, Samson tells the groomsmen a riddle involving honey in the carcass of a lion; the groomsmen force his betrothed to tell them the answer. Samson’s betrothed is eventually married to another man, causing an enraged Samson to burn the Philistines’ crops and slay 1,000 men with the jawbone of a donkey. Samson’s downfall comes when he falls in love with Delilah, who seduces him for the secret of his strength, then cuts his hair while he is asleep. He is captured and blinded by the Philistines, who display him in the Temple of Dagon. However, he regains his strength and collapses the temple, killing himself and everyone else inside.\n\nSamuel is a prophet and the namesake of the two books that follow Ruth and precede 1 Kings. Samuel’s mother, Hannah, prays to the Lord for a child, and promises that should she conceive a son she will dedicate him to the service of the Lord. Shortly thereafter, Hannah becomes pregnant with Samuel. When Samuel is a young boy, the Lord calls to him during the night, though he mistakes the voice for that of the head priest Eli, whose downfall he subsequently foretells. As an adult, Samuel leads Israel to a major victory over the Philistines at Mizpah, erecting the stone Ebenezer on the site. At the Israelites’ request, he anoints Saul as the first king of Israel; Saul eventually loses his favor by sparing King Agag of the Amalekites in battle. After Samuel’s death, Saul calls upon the Witch of Endor to summon up Samuel’s ghost; Samuel’s spirit predicts a crushing defeat for Israel at the hands of the Philistines.\n\nDavid is a son of Jesse of Bethlehem. David succeeded Saul as King of Israel and is traditionally held to be a direct ancestor of Jesus. David first takes command of Israel’s army after he uses a simple sling to slay the massive Philistine champion Goliath, an event depicted in sculpture by Michelangelo and Donatello, among others. Though Saul becomes jealous of David and tries to kill him, David escapes with the help of Saul’s son Jonathan, with whom he shares a deep relationship that some modern scholars have interpreted as romantic. As king, David captures the city of Jerusalem and installs the Ark of the Covenant there. He falls in love with the married woman Bathsheba and sends her husband Uriah the Hittite to be killed in battle; this earns him a strong rebuke from the prophet Nathan. David’s children include Absalom, who leads a rebellion against him. David is recognized as the traditional author of the Psalms.\n\nSolomon is a son of David who succeeds his father as king. As a young man, Solomon is visited by the Lord, who asks what Solomon desires; Solomon’s reply of “wisdom” pleased the Lord, who granted the request. In the best-known episode illustrating Solomon’s wisdom, he orders that a child be cut in half to determine its true mother. Under Solomon’s rule, Israel built the First Temple of Jerusalem, also known as the Temple of Solomon, whose innermost chamber housed the Ark of the Covenant. Solomon amassed great wealth and had 700 wives. In a short episode that inspired numerous artists, Solomon was visited by the Queen of Sheba. Traditionally, Solomon is considered the author of the books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon (or Song of Songs), as well as the deuterocanonical Wisdom of Solomon.\n\nElijah the Tishbite is a powerful prophet during the reign of King Ahab and his pagan wife Jezebel. Elijah denounces Ahab’s worship of Baal and predicts a three-year drought, after which he flees into the wilderness and is fed by ravens. During this time, Elijah stays with a widow in the town of Zarephath and performs miracles such as multiplying her flour supply and raising her son from the dead. At the end of the drought, Elijah challenges the priests of Baal to a dramatic contest on Mount Carmel where he summons fire from heaven to ignite a burnt offering. Elijah’s mission is carried on by his student Elisha, who asks for a “double portion” of Elijah’s spirit as Elijah bodily ascends to Heaven, carried up on a chariot of fire. Elijah also appears briefly in the New Testament, when both he and Moses converse with Jesus during the Transfiguration. In Jewish tradition, Elijah will appear to herald the coming of the Messiah.\n\nDaniel is a Jew who is brought to the court of Nebuchadnezzar II during the Jewish captivity in Babylon. Daniel interprets dreams for the king, including one in which an enormous statue represents four successive kingdoms that will supplant Babylon, and another predicting that Nebuchadnezzar will suffer from seven years of madness. In one episode, Nebuchadnezzar casts Daniel’s friends Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into a furnace, but all three emerge unscathed. Daniel also serves the later ruler Belshazzar and interprets a mysterious hand that writes on the wall during a feast, predicting Belshazzar’s downfall—which comes that night. In the best-known episode from Daniel’s life, Darius the Mede casts Daniel into a lion’s den after Daniel disobeys an order not to worship the god of Israel; after Daniel emerges unharmed, Darius has those who accused Daniel thrown into the lion’s den instead, where they are killed.\n\nJonah is a minor prophet sent by God to preach repentance to the city of Nineveh. Jonah is reluctant to do so and instead boards a ship to Tarshish, but God sends a massive storm to disrupt his journey. Jonah is cast overboard by the crew and swallowed by a large fish, which spits him onto the shore after three days. Jonah eventually continues on to Nineveh and convinces its inhabitants to repent by donning sackcloth and ashes. Indignant that God spared the city from destruction, Jonah sits outside the city, where God causes a gourd to grow over him and provide him shade. A worm then devours the gourd, exposing him to the heat of the Sun; God uses Jonah’s suffering to show Jonah that he should have pity on the people of Nineveh. The Book of Jonah is traditionally read in the afternoon on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur."

    "title": "Magazines From American History",
    "content": "Harper’s Weekly (1857–1916) was the most popular American magazine during the Civil War. In 1863 it published an article about a slave named Gordon along with a widely circulated photograph of his whipped, mutilated back that roused abolitionist sentiment across the North. George William Curtis, a co-founder of the Republican Party, was its political editor from 1863 to 1892, during which time he ran cartoons by Thomas Nast, including Nast’s portrayals of Boss Tweed and the Tammany Hall political machine. (Although Nast’s Harper’s Weekly work did popularize American symbols like Uncle Sam, Columbia, and the Democratic donkey, Nast was not the inventor of those symbols.)\n\nThe Atlantic (1857–present) was founded in Boston as an abolitionist periodical by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., and many others. In 1862 it published Julia Ward Howe’s “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” and in 1963 it published Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail” for a nationwide audience. More recently, it ran Ta-Nehisi Coates’s 2014 article “The Case for Reparations,” which advocates reimbursing the descendants of American slaves. Despite its political emphasis, it has only ever endorsed three presidential candidates: Abraham Lincoln in 1864, Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nPuck (1871–1915) was a humor and satire magazine best remembered for its vivid political cartoons. Founded by Austrian-born Joseph Keppler, it often glorified American imperialism and had an anti-Catholic lens. Iconic cartoons over its 45-year run include Jay Gould using Wall Street as a “personal bowling alley,” robber barons slicing up America with carving knives, John D. Rockefeller as a king with an huge crown of railroads, Uncle Sam as a schoolteacher looming over racist caricatures of its new territories, and Columbia admiring her bonnet of gunboats in a mirror. (Puck should not be confused with Punch, a British magazine of the same era also noted for its political cartoons.)\n\nMcClure’s Magazine (1893–1929) was founded explicitly to publish the investigative journalism now known as “muckraking.” In 1901 its staff writer Ray Stannard Baker published What the U.S. Steel Corporation Really Is, and How It Works. In 1902 it ran Ida Tarbell’s The History of the Standard Oil Company. Lincoln Steffens’s series on political machines, Tweed Days in St. Louis, was later compiled as the 1906 book The Shame of the Cities. Willa Cather helped write its highly skeptical 1909 biography The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science.\n\nCosmopolitan (1886–present) began as a classy, largely inoffensive magazine until 1965, when Helen Gurley Brown became its editor and made it a women’s magazine geared towards fashion and romantic relationships. (Three years prior, Brown rose to fame for her popular, controversial non-fiction book Sex and the Single Girl.) Cosmopolitan’s new angle was viewed as misogynistic by most leading feminists; copies were burned alongside Playboy at protests against the 1968 Miss America pageant. In 1989 it ran an article falsely stating heterosexual women cannot contract HIV, prompting protests from ACT UP and other gay organizations.\n\nTime (1923–present) was the U.S.’s first weekly newsmagazine. Its founder, Henry Luce, used its near-instant success to create a stable of influential magazines, including Life, Fortune, and Sports Illustrated. Since 1927 it has designated various figures as “Person of the Year” (originally “Man of the Year”), the first being Charles Lindbergh; controversial picks for the award include Adolf Hitler in 1938 and Joseph Stalin in both 1939 and 1942. In June 1994, Time was criticized for darkening the mugshot of O. J. Simpson on its cover, especially juxtaposed against Newsweek’s largely undoctored version on their cover the same month. After 9/11, Time’s cover showed the second plane flying into the Twin Towers and used a black border in place of its iconic red border.\n\nNational Review (1955–present) was founded by the foremost leader of the American conservative movement in the 20th century, William F. Buckley Jr., and aimed from its outset to define and promote right-wing thought. Its earliest editors were staunch anti-Communists like Whittaker Chambers. Under Buckley, National Review expanded conservatism’s allies to include libertarians while disavowing anti-Semitic and nativist elements, such as the John Birch Society. After Barry Goldwater’s defeat in 1964, National Review rallied conservatism behind the up-and-coming Ronald Reagan. Buckley parlayed his success with National Review into hosting PBS’s Firing Line from 1966 to 1999.\n\nRolling Stone (1967–present) was founded in San Francisco as a rock and roll magazine, but it quickly became notable for its experimental political journalism. In 1970 the magazine won acclaim for its pieces on the tragic Altamont Free Concert and on Charles Manson while he was in jail awaiting trial. The magazine is indelibly associated with the gonzo journalism of Hunter S. Thompson—his seminal novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the political piece Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ’72 first appeared in Rolling Stone. After becoming more Hollywood-geared in the 1990s, in the 2000s it re-oriented itself towards politics. In 2014 it generated public outcry over its allegedly “glamorizing” cover photo of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers.\n\nMs. (1971–present) is a pioneering feminist magazine, founded by Gloria Steinem and Dorothy Pitman Hughes. In its first decade, it favored changes to common phrases and nouns to make them gender-neutral. Its preview cover showed the goddess Kali holding domestic objects in her eight hands, while its first proper cover depicted Wonder Woman. In 1972, before Roe v. Wade, it ran an article about 53 women who admitted to getting abortions despite it still being illegal. While editor of Ms. in 1975, Alice Walker published “In Search of Zora Neale Hurston” after locating the author’s unmarked grave."

    "title": "Spies",
    "content": "Sir Francis Walsingham (1532–1590) is best known as the “spymaster” to Elizabeth I. After the accession of Mary I to the English throne, Walsingham fled with several prominent Protestants to Europe; there, he became radicalized against Catholicism upon witnessing the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre. As personal secretary to Elizabeth, Walsingham amassed a web of contacts, including Thomas Phelippes, the cryptographer who uncovered Mary, Queen of Scots’s complicity in the Babington Plot. In 1587 Walsingham recruited Antony Standen due to Standen’s friendship with Tuscany’s ambassador to Spain, an arrangement that produced so many advance details about the Spanish Armada that Lord Henry Seymour quipped “you have fought more with your pen than…our English navy fought with their enemies.” Though it has never been proven, author Christopher Marlowe is commonly believed to have been a spy for Walsingham.\n\nGiacomo Casanova (1725–1798) was an adventurer and libertine from the Republic of Venice. He is now best remembered for his affairs, to the extent that his name is synonymous with “womanizer,” but among many other occupations, he also worked as a spy. His spying, which he described in his French-language memoir Histoire de ma vie (Story of My Life), included a stint working for France gathering information on the British ships docked in Dunkirk. He spent much of his life in exile from his native Venice, running from the authorities to avoid being arrested for his debts, but was allowed to return to Venice in 1774 in exchange for performing espionage work for the republic.\n\nNathan Hale (1755–1776) only participated in one spying mission, which failed, but his purported final words have become part of American legend. At the age of 21, Hale was a soldier in the Continental Army and agreed to undertake a spying mission to pose as a neutral citizen, disguised as a Dutch schoolmaster, in New York City. Hale was almost immediately exposed (possibly by his Loyalist cousin) and subsequently interrogated by Commander-in-Chief William Howe and then hanged as a spy. His supposed final words, much quoted in Patriot propaganda, were “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.”\n\nThe Culper Ring (active 1778–1783) was organized by Benjamin Tallmadge (a schoolmate of Nathan Hale) under the supervision of George Washington. The ring takes its name from Samuel Culper, the alias of chief agent Abraham Woodhull. The Ring operated near New York City and was very successful: they exposed a plot to render Continental currency worthless through a massive counterfeiting scheme; they found that the 1779 Tryon’s Raid was part of a trap devised by Henry Clinton; and they determined that Benedict Arnold was conspiring with British intelligence officer John André to hand over West Point. André himself was captured on his return from a night meeting with Arnold when he encountered two American soldiers, one of whom was wearing a stolen Hessian officer’s coat, causing André to mistake them for allies and identify himself. His captors, ignorant of Arnold’s role, remanded André to Arnold’s custody. Tallmadge, however, suspected that Arnold was his accomplice, and Washington had André tried and hanged as a spy.\n\nBelle Boyd (1844–1900) was a society woman from Virginia whose 1866 memoir Belle Boyd in Camp and Prison provides a highly embellished chronicle of her exploits. She claims she listened through a hotel’s closet door to learn of James Shields’s troop maneuvers, which she reported to Stonewall Jackson’s men by literally sprinting across a battlefield. Tracked by operatives of Allan Pinkerton, Boyd was arrested in 1862 and eventually released in a prisoner exchange. Sailing to England with letters from Jefferson Davis, her blockade runner was captured, after which she reportedly seduced her guard to allow the blockade runner’s captain to escape. Though Boyd’s spying contributions were scant, she later became an actress and lecturer on her actions, with the result that she was frequently mythologized in post-war Southern propaganda.\n\nFerdinand Esterhazy (1847–1923) was the French military officer and spy for the German Empire who perpetrated the acts of espionage wrongfully pinned on Alfred Dreyfus in 1894, prompting the Dreyfus Affair. Esterhazy is believed to have written a sensitive missive known as the bordereau that was found in a trash can by a janitor; this was the key evidence in blaming Dreyfus, whose handwriting was determined (by unqualified scholars) to be a match. Gradually, evidence came to light incriminating Esterhazy, including a letter from the German attache in Paris acquired by Georges Picquart. Esterhazy requested a closed-door trial that exonerated him in 1898, which was seen as a cover-up by French commanders to avoid embarrassment at convicting the wrong man.\n\nSidney Reilly (1873–1925), known as the “Ace of Spies,” was an extremely prolific Russian-born spy primarily in the service of the U.K. and Japan, though he also worked for Germany and Russia. His identity as Sidney Reilly was likely created by William Melville, a Scotland Yard agent for whom he worked as an informant. His global career included stints in Port Arthur, where he stole defense plans that allowed Japan to sneak-attack Port Arthur to spark the Russo-Japanese War; in France, where he snuck onto a Rothschild family yacht to try to convince William Knox D’Arcy to sell his oil rights to the British government; in Germany, where he pretended to be a factory foreman named Karl Hahn to steal weapons plans for Britain; and in Russia, where he may have led a failed 1918 plot to overthrow the Bolsheviks. Undercover agents in Russia eventually exposed him, leading to his execution in 1925.\n\nMata Hari (1876–1917) was an exotic dancer who used her neutral Dutch citizenship to spy for France, and possibly also for Germany, in World War I. Born Margaretha Zelle, she adopted the persona of a Malay princess to further her career, which brought her into sexual relationships with high-ranking military figures and nobles. In 1917, French intelligence determined she was spying for Germany while producing no worthwhile information of benefit to France, leading to her arrest and conviction, though scholarship is still sharply divided on whether she was merely a high-profile scapegoat. Both pop culture and academia have long been intrigued by the racy appeal of Mata Hari’s story, embodied by her 1917 execution, at which she blew kisses to her firing squad, though photographic records disprove urban legends that she wore a lavish new outfit for her execution.\n\nThe Cambridge Five (active 1934–1951) was a quintet of British agents disillusioned about capitalism who were recruited as Soviet spies while attending Cambridge University. Supervised by Yuri Modin of the KGB, it included Donald MacLean, Guy Burgess, John Cairncross, Anthony Blunt, and Kim Philby. The KGB believed Maclean and Burgess to be exceptionally sloppy in maintaining their covers, but the two agents still passed over 9,000 secret wartime documents to the KGB before fleeing the U.K. in 1951, at which point the British press learned of the existence of the ring. Kim Philby maintained his innocence until 1963, when he defected during an intelligence mission to Beirut.\n\nJulius and Ethel Rosenberg (1918–1953 and 1915–1953) were a married couple from New York City who supplied Manhattan Project secrets to the Soviets. Julius recruited many informants, whose raw intelligence was then typed up by Ethel. The most important Rosenberg recruits were Russell McNutt, who worked at Oak Ridge Laboratory, and Ethel’s brother David Greenglass, who worked at Los Alamos and ferried Julius diagrams of atomic weapons. The Rosenbergs were found out in 1950 after the spy Klaus Fuchs implicated his courier, Harry Gold, setting off a chain of confessions and exposures that ended with David Greenglass, who exposed Julius and Ethel as part of a plea deal. The Rosenbergs were then aggressively prosecuted by Roy Cohn (later a key figure in the McCarthy Era) and executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison. In 1995 the Venona Project confirmed that Julius bore the codename “Liberal” as a Soviet operative."

    "content": "Resistor A resistor is an element that impedes the flow of current, creating a voltage drop. Resistance is measured in ohms, named for Georg Ohm and symbolized by a capital omega (Ω). Resistors are governed by Ohm’s law, V = IR. In other words, the voltage drop across a resistor (V) equals the current passing through the resistor (I) times the resistor’s resistance (R). According to Joule’s first law, the power dissipated by a resistor is P = I2R. Combining that fact with Ohm’s law yields P = IV. The total resistance of a circuit depends on whether resistors are arranged in parallel (different branches connecting to the same pair of nodes) or series (same branch). If two resistors having resistance R1 and R2 are placed in series, the total resistance across them is R = R1 + R2; if they are placed in parallel, then 1/R = 1/R1 +1/ R2. A rheostat, or variable resistor, can be made by taking a material of uniform resistivity and changing how much of the material is in the circuit. A potentiometer is a rheostat with two terminals and a connection in the middle, so the middle terminal can set a precise, variable dividing point between the ends; therefore, a potentiometer can be used as a voltage divider. Rheostats and potentiometers are often operated by knobs or sliders. A Wheatstone bridge is a diamond-shaped arrangement of two resistors of known resistance, one rheostat, and a resistor of unknown resistance. With a DC voltage source between the two known resistors, and also between the rheostat and the unknown resistor, this setup can be used to find the resistance of the unknown resistor: an ammeter (device to measure current) is connected across the two other nodes and the rheostat is adjusted until no current flows. The formula for solving a Wheatstone bridge uses Kirchhoff’s laws: the total current flowing into any point in a circuit equals the total current flowing out of the point, and the total voltage change around any loop of a circuit is 0 V.\n\nCapacitor A capacitor is a charge-storing disconnection in a circuit, usually made of parallel plates separated by a medium that blocks the passage of charge. The inner medium is called a dielectric. The governing equation of a capacitor is Q = C ΔV: the charge stored on the capacitor (Q, typically measured in coulombs) equals the capacitor’s capacitance (C, typically measured in farads, or more likely in smaller units like microfarads) times the voltage across the capacitor (ΔV). The total capacitance of a circuit depends on whether capacitors are arranged in parallel or series, but in the opposite fashion as for resistors: If two capacitors having capacitance C1 and C2 are placed in parallel, the total capacitance across them is C = C1 + C2; if they are placed in series, then 1/C = 1/C1 +1/ C2. This is because wiring capacitors in parallel effectively expands the area of the parallel plates, so configuring capacitors in parallel increases total capacitance.\n\nInductor A solenoid is a coil of wire. When electric current through the wire changes, a magnetic field is generated in the core (interior) of the solenoid. When a solenoid is used in a circuit, it is called an inductor and serves to oppose changes in the current in the circuit. The strength of an inductor is its inductance, symbolized L and measured in henries (after Joseph Henry, who discovered the principles of self-inductance and mutual inductance, though Michael Faraday published his findings on electromagnetic induction first). The voltage across an inductor only depends on the change in current, so inductors are particularly used with alternating current. For standard (sinusoidal) alternating current, an inductor only changes the phase of the current through it. Inductors function the same way as resistors when arranged in series or parallel.\n\nTransformer A transformer is a pair of solenoids connected to a central core, which permits the circulation of magnetic flux. Because the flux in the core is constant, an alternating current in one coil produces a changing magnetic field, inducing an alternating current in the second coil. If the coils have different numbers of turns of wire (as is typical), the current in the second coil will have a different voltage than the current in the first coil. Therefore, transformers are used to “step up” or “step down” voltage, for example in power transmission lines and in adapters for household electronics.\n\nSource A source is any device that provides voltage or current. Direct current (DC) sources like batteries provide constant current, while alternating current (AC) sources like household electric outlets provide current that changes at a regular frequency with a constant average voltage. In alternating-current circuits, capacitors and inductors can help tune a circuit’s efficiency by contributing to a phenomenon called impedance, which is the complex analogue of resistance. A circuit’s reactance is the imaginary part of its impedance and depends on the frequency of the circuit. When reactance is balanced, we find the frequency at which the circuit loses the least energy, or its resonant frequency.\n\nGround A ground or earth is a point on a circuit that is connected to the ground. This is to prevent accidental discharge of electricity from an unexpected connection—a person who touches an ungrounded circuit might cause electricity to pass through their body. This lets ground act as a known reference point of voltage for analyzing circuits: any grounded point in the circuit is typically understood to have zero voltage.\n\nFuses and circuit breakers When excess current flows through a fuse, the fuse deforms or disconnects so that no current can flow in the circuit. This protects the equipment in the circuit from being damaged by power surges and also protects the surroundings (as excess current can cause wires to overheat, starting a fire). Fuses typically melt and thus must be completely replaced after tripping; a circuit breaker is a form of fuse that can be reset and restored after the circuit has been verified to be safe.\n\nSwitch A switch is simply a device that toggles between an open connection and a closed connection. Switches can also be used to toggle between two (or more) different closed connections.\n\nDiode A diode permits the flow of current in only one direction. Ideally, a diode permits any amount of current in one direction but has a very high resistance to current in the opposite direction. In practice, there is a minimum voltage that must be provided before current will flow, called the bias voltage, and there is a voltage past which the resistance of the diode reduces and current flows backward, called the breakdown voltage. In a Zener diode, the breakdown voltage is well-defined with as sharp a transition as possible, so engineers can design a circuit around the breakdown voltage characteristic.\n\nLED An LED, or light-emitting diode, is a diode that lights up when current passes through in the forward direction.\n\nRectifier A rectifier is a device that converts AC or another variable signal into a positive-voltage signal. A half-wave rectifier simply zeroes out negative voltage, while a full-wave rectifier essentially acts as an absolute value function, converting negative voltage to positive voltage. A rectifier can be combined with a capacitor to approximately convert AC into DC.\n\nOp-amp An op-amp (operational amplifier) is a five-port device that changes a voltage difference across two ports, multiplied by a factor (gain), into a voltage on an output port, using power supplied to two power ports. There are various ways to wire an op-amp, often feeding an output back into an input, to accomplish interesting tasks like subtracting and multiplying voltages. An ideal op-amp is assumed to have infinite gain, so when solving a circuit, the two inputs must reach a point with no voltage difference across them. Real op-amps have finite gain, impedance across their inputs, resistance on their output, and a finite bandwidth or spread of operating frequencies when used with alternating current."

    "title": "Vice Presidents Who Never Became President",
    "content": "Aaron Burr (1756–1836) was Thomas Jefferson’s first vice president, serving from 1801 to 1805. Before taking office, he served as a senator from New York and helped build the Tammany Society (which became Tammany Hall) and the Manhattan Company (which became Chase Manhattan Bank). In 1800 Burr swung New York to his running mate Jefferson, but due to a constitutional quirk, he wound up tying him in the Electoral College. Burr made a covert effort to become president with support from the Federalist Party, but it was blocked by Alexander Hamilton, whom Burr later killed in a duel. In 1807 the Jefferson administration put Burr on trial for treason for plotting to set up his own country in land acquired from the Louisiana Purchase, though he was acquitted.\n\nElbridge Gerry (1744–1814) was James Madison’s second vice president, serving from 1813 to 1814 (when he died in office). At the Constitutional Convention, Gerry joined George Mason and Edmund Randolph in refusing to sign the Constitution, largely because it lacked a Bill of Rights. In 1797 he, Charles C. Pinckney, and John Marshall were sent to France as a diplomatic commission, but French agents demanded bribes during the “XYZ Affair.” As governor of Massachusetts in 1812, Gerry reluctantly approved a partisan redistricting plan. A Federalist publication joked that one of the new districts resembled a salamander, giving rise to the term “gerrymandering.”\n\nJohn C. Calhoun (1782–1850) was John Quincy Adams’ vice president and Andrew Jackson’s first vice president, serving from 1825 to 1832 (when he resigned). Early in his career, Calhoun became one of the leading “war hawks” who supported the War of 1812. While Calhoun served as Jackson’s vice president, his wife Floride snubbed the wife of Secretary of War John Eaton during the Petticoat Affair. Calhoun supported the doctrine of nullification embraced by his home state of South Carolina to oppose the so-called “Tariff of Abominations,” and to express his opposition to Jackson, he became the first vice president to resign. During his later career as a senator, Calhoun became the nation’s leading advocate for states’ rights and slavery, which he called a “positive good.”\n\nJohn C. Breckinridge (1821–1875) was James Buchanan’s vice president, serving from 1857 to 1861. Taking office at just age 36, he remains the youngest ever vice president. In 1860 the former Kentucky congressman became the presidential candidate of southern Democrats who refused to support Stephen Douglas. He finished second with 72 electoral votes but lost the election to Abraham Lincoln, whose wife Mary Todd was a distant cousin of Breckinridge. When the Civil War broke out, he enlisted in the Confederate Army, causing him to be expelled from the Senate. As a southern general, he won the Battle of New Market and served as the last Confederate secretary of war.\n\nCharles Dawes (1865–1951) was Calvin Coolidge’s vice president, serving from 1925 to 1929. Dawes is the only vice president to compose a number-one song, writing the music for what became the 1958 hit “It’s All in the Game.” A successful banker, Dawes proposed the Dawes plan to resolve the financial crisis in Europe after World War I, through which the U.S. gave money to Germany so it could repay reparations to Britain and France. For his effort, Dawes won a Nobel Peace Prize. He later served as the first head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which Herbert Hoover founded to alleviate the Great Depression.\n\nHubert Humphrey (1911–1978) was Lyndon Johnson’s vice president, serving from 1965 to 1969. As mayor of Minneapolis, Humphrey introduced an anti-segregation plank in the 1948 Democratic platform, which led southern delegates to walk out and form the “Dixiecrat” party. As a senator from Minnesota, Humphrey was instrumental in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. After he became Johnson’s vice president, Humphrey faced criticism for supporting the president’s Vietnam War policies. During a convention marred by riots in Chicago, Humphrey won the 1968 Democratic nomination for president, but lost a close election to Richard Nixon. He returned to the Senate, dying in office in 1978.\n\nSpiro Theodore “Ted” Agnew (1918–1996) was Richard Nixon’s first vice president, serving from 1969 to 1973 (when he resigned). Agnew and John C. Calhoun are the only vice presidents to resign from office. Agnew served as governor of Maryland, where his moderate reputation and “law and order” policies led Nixon to choose him as his running mate. Agnew became known as Nixon’s “attack dog,” unleashing such creative insults as calling liberals “nattering nabobs of negativism.” In 1973 an investigation into Agnew’s tenure as governor discovered that he had received bribes from contractors. Though he professed his innocence, Agnew ultimately pled no contest to tax evasion and resigned as vice president, ending his political career.\n\nNelson Aldrich Rockefeller (1908–1979) was Gerald Ford’s vice president, serving from 1974 to 1977. A grandson of Standard Oil founder John Rockefeller, he served as governor of New York from 1959 to 1973 and crushed the Attica Prison Uprising. Rockefeller led the “Eastern Establishment,” the liberal wing of the Republican Party. He sought his party’s presidential nomination in 1960, 1964, and 1968, losing partly due to his controversial second marriage with Happy Murphy. After succeeding Richard Nixon, Ford used the 25th Amendment to appoint Rockefeller as vice president, but reluctantly dropped him as his running mate in 1976 in favor of Bob Dole.\n\nAl Gore (or Albert Arnold Gore Jr.) (1948–) was Bill Clinton’s vice president, serving from 1993 to 2001. Like his father, Gore was a senator from Tennessee, and during his tenure he wrote the best-selling ecological book Earth in the Balance. As vice president, Gore supported environmental and technological causes, including popularizing the term “Information Superhighway” (and at one point remarking that he “took the initiative in creating the Internet”). As the Democratic presidential candidate in 2000, Gore lost a disputed election to George W. Bush that hinged on the Supreme Court halting a recount in Florida. After leaving office, Gore made the documentary An Inconvenient Truth about climate change, which won him the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nDick Cheney (or Richard Bruce Cheney) (1941–) was George W. Bush’s vice president, serving from 2001 to 2009. Before taking office, Cheney served as Gerald Ford’s chief of staff, secretary of defense during the First Gulf War, and CEO of Halliburton. Cheney was an extremely influential vice president, shaping strategy around the War on Terror and Second Gulf War. However, he was dogged by controversies: his chief of staff Scooter Libby was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with the leaking of the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame, and he shot a 78-year-old man in the face in a hunting accident. In 2016 his daughter Liz Cheney won his old seat as Wyoming’s representative in Congress, where she became a leading critic of Donald Trump."

    "title": "20th-century Middle Eastern Leaders",
    "content": "Yasser Arafat (1929–2004) was the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from 1969 until shortly before his death in 2004. In the late 1950s, Arafat and other Palestinian refugees founded the political party Fatah, which in the late 1960s became the dominant faction within the PLO. Under Arafat’s leadership, the PLO was based in Jordan until it was expelled in 1970 in Black September. With Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Arafat negotiated the 1993 Oslo Accords establishing the Palestinian National Authority.\n\nHafez al-Assad (1930–2000) was the president of Syria from 1971 to 2000. Assad, a member of the Alawite minority sect within Islam, was the commander of the Syrian Air Force when he came to power as a member of the Ba’ath Party. Along with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, Assad launched the Yom Kippur War against Israel in 1973. In 1982, Assad brutally crushed an Islamist uprising led by members of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Syrian city of Hama. Hafez was succeeded as president of Syria by his son, Bashar al-Assad.\n\nMustafa Kamal Atatürk (1881–1938) was the founder of the modern Republic of Turkey and the country’s first president. He rose to prominence as a commander of Ottoman forces at the Battle of Gallipoli during World War I. After the war, he dissolved the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic caliphate and created a secular nationalist state based in Ankara. Among the reforms Atatürk initiated were a Hat Law replacing the fez with Western-style hats, the adoption of family surnames, and use of the Latin alphabet for the written Turkish language.\n\nMuammar Gaddafi (1942–2011) was the leader of Libya from 1969 to 2011, during which time he was variously styled as “Colonel,” “Revolutionary Chairman,” and “Brotherly Leader.” Gaddafi espoused what he called “Islamic socialism” in his Green Book. He coined the word jamahiriya, which can be roughly translated as “state of the masses.” Gaddafi funded various Islamist militant operations around the world, most notably the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011 during the Arab Spring.\n\nDavid Ben-Gurion (1886–1973) was a Zionist leader and principal figure in the founding of the state of Israel. He served as the first prime minister of Israel from 1948 to 1954, as a member of the political party Mapai; his second term as prime minister lasted from 1955 to 1963. Ben-Gurion was born in what is now Poland and immigrated to the Ottoman district of Jerusalem in 1906. He became chairman of the Jewish Agency in 1935, and was the main political leader of the Jewish forces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.\n\nRuhollah Khomeini (1902–1989) was the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and served as Iran’s supreme leader from the country’s 1979 establishment until his 1989 death. Khomeini was known by the title ayatollah, given to those who are experts in Shi’ite religious theology and jurisprudence. Khomeini emerged as Iran’s leader in the wake of the revolution that overthrew Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last shah of Iran, and which led to the Iranian hostage crisis. He commonly referred to the U.S. as the “Great Satan.”\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser (1918–1970) was the president of Egypt from 1954 to 1970. As a young military commander, he helped form the Free Officers, who led a 1952 coup that overthrew Egypt’s king, Farouk I. Nasser precipitated the Suez Crisis by nationalizing the Suez Canal in 1956. He championed a pan-Arabist sentiment that eventually led to Egypt’s brief union with Syria as the United Arab Republic in 1958. Nasser oversaw Egypt’s disastrous defeat by Israel in the Six-Day War (1967).\n\nAnwar Sadat (1918–1981) was president of Egypt from 1970 to 1981. He succeeded Nasser, a fellow member of the Free Officers, upon the latter’s sudden death. Sadat launched the Yom Kippur War against Israel in 1973. Five years later, due in large part to the efforts of U.S. president Jimmy Carter, Sadat signed the Camp David Accords with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, for which Sadat and Begin were jointly awarded the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by an Islamist military officer associated with the radical group Egyptian Islamic Jihad.\n\nSaddam Hussein (1937–2006) was the president of Iraq from 1979 to 2003. He came to power as a member of the pan-Arabist Ba’ath Party. During the 1980s, Hussein led Iraq in the decade-long Iran-Iraq War. In the midst of that conflict, he launched the genocidal Al-Anfal Campaign against Kurdish civilians in northern Iraq. In 1990, Saddam ordered the invasion of neighboring Kuwait, which led to the First Gulf War, also known as Operation Desert Storm. Hussein was deposed following 2003 the American invasion of Iraq; he was tried and executed by the new Iraqi government in 2006.\n\nAbdulaziz ibn Abdul Rahman Al Saud, usually known in the West as Ibn Saud (1875–1953), was the first king of Saudi Arabia. He reconquered Riyadh, his family’s ancestral homeland, in 1902, and began expanding Saudi power from there; in 1925, he conquered the Hejaz, the region where Mecca is located. Ibn Saud declared the formation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932; during his reign, American engineers discovered oil at Dammam in 1938. Every subsequent king of Saudi Arabia has been a son of Ibn Saud, including the current (as of October 2019) king, Salman."

    "title": "Jewish Lifecycle Events",
    "content": "Brit milah, or bris in Yiddish and in the dialect of Ashkenazic Jews (those of European but non-Iberian descent), is the ritual of circumcising Jewish boys, that is, removing the foreskin of the penis. This practice derives from God’s instruction to Abraham, after which Abraham circumcised himself and later circumcised his son Isaac. It is done to all boys when they reach eight days old (unless a health condition requires a delay) by a professional called a mohel MOY-ul in Yiddish/Ashkanazi dialect. During the operation, the boy is held by a person (often a grandfather) designated the sandek, which is an honor. Medical anesthetic is not used, but often the baby is given a drop of wine. The ritual is followed by a s’udah, a celebratory meal.\n\nBaby naming, or simchat bat. Jewish children are given Hebrew names. For boys, the name is formally announced, and blessings are recited, at the brit milah ceremony. For girls, the same is done at a separate event, often (but not necessarily) during a regular synagogue service in the first few weeks of the baby’s life. This tradition is primarily observed in more liberal Jewish movements and is not considered religiously required, so practices vary and are evolving. The Hebrew name is used on special occasions such as being called to the Torah and being married, and is typically in the form “Yitzchak ben Avraham” (Isaac, son of Abraham) or (in egalitarian movements) “Yitzchak ben Avraham v’Sarah” (Isaac, son of Abraham and Sarah).\n\nPidyon ha-ben. Traditionally, by default, firstborn sons are obligated to assist in the Temple in Jerusalem. As there is currently no Temple, this requirement is symbolic, but it is traditional to “redeem” such people from their obligations if possible. Children in priestly families (kohanim, singular kohen, descendants of Moses’s brother Aaron) and Levite families (descendants of Levi) cannot be redeemed from service. Traditionally, the child’s father pays a kohen five silver coins in exchange for the child’s freedom, shortly after the child becomes one month old. Blessings and a meal accompany the ritual.\n\nBar/bat mitzvah (masculine and feminine singular, respectively; masculine, mixed, or nonspecific plural b’nai mitzvah; feminine plural b’not mitzvah; feminine singular in Yiddish/Ashkenazi dialect bas mitzvah) is the designation that a Jewish person has reached adulthood. Traditionally this is at age 13 for boys/men and age 12 for girls/women. Although a bar/bat mitzvah occurs upon the birthday regardless of whether any ceremony takes place, traditionally the occasion is marked at a service at the synagogue around that time; the honoree will wear a tallit (prayer shawl) for the first time, be called up for an honor (aliyah) for the first time, read from the Torah (first five books of the Bible) and haftarah (a portion of one of the prophets’ books, linked to the week’s Torah portion), and give a d’var Torah, a discourse on the meaning of the week’s Torah portion. A celebratory meal or party often follows. The bar mitzvah for boys dates back to ancient times in varying forms; the bat mitzvah mainly arose in the 20th century. After becoming bar mitzvah, a man is responsible for fulfilling the 613 commandments in the Torah and may be counted toward a minyan (quorum required for certain prayers); in egalitarian movements the same applies to a woman who has become bat mitzvah.\n\nConfirmation is a modern ritual (developed in the 19th century) and is non-obligatory. It is primarily used in more secular movements, and represents the fact that a person has continued formal Jewish education past the bar/bat mitzvah and has now completed that formal education. Rituals vary widely, but generally there is recognition in the synagogue of the confirmation class (all at once, unlike for b’nai mitzvah), religious gifts may be given, and—as with nearly all Jewish events—food is served.\n\nMarriage in Judaism is a complex ritual that varies according to the couple’s and their community’s relationships with Judaism. For the sake of brevity, here we will discuss marriages between a Jewish man and a Jewish woman. Jewish attitudes and approaches toward non-heterosexual marriages are too varied and evolving to summarize here, and Judaism discourages Jewish people from marrying non-Jewish people (intermarriage). In many communities, especially Ashkenazic ones, the wedding is preceded by an aufruf: on the Shabbat (Saturday) before the wedding, the groom is (or in egalitarian congregations, the bride and the groom are) called to the Torah to receive an honor and a blessing, after which the congregation sings to them and pelts them with candy, representing a sweet life. Immediately before the wedding proper, two witnesses sign a ketubah, or marriage contract, which details the groom’s obligations toward the bride (home, food, clothing, sex, faithfulness). In egalitarian movements the wording is adjusted and the bride and groom also sign. The ketubah is frequently a beautiful, illuminated document, and the couple will often display it in their home. The wedding ceremony takes place under a chuppah, a canopy supported on four poles, symbolizing the couple’s home. The bride’s face is veiled—recalling Genesis, in which Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Leah rather than Rachel by having the bride veiled at the ceremony, but to prevent such an occurrence, the groom removes the veil to verify that he will marry the correct person. The bride walks around the groom three or seven times. The groom presents the bride with an object of value (typically a ring), and in egalitarian weddings, vice versa. Seven blessings (Hebrew: sheva b’rachot) formalize the marriage. The groom breaks a glass (or in egalitarian movements, the bride and groom may break a glass together) to remind the community that even at a joyous occasion there is still sorrow (particularly with respect to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem). The wedding is followed by a festive meal and party. Dancing is common, especially the hora, and it is traditional to lift the bride and groom on chairs. Traditionally, a special version of birkat ha-mazon (grace after meals) is recited.\n\nDivorce is discouraged, but permitted, in Judaism. It is effected by a document called a get. By Jewish law, a husband must present a wife with a get of his own free will, and traditionally (but not by law) she must choose to accept it. The former presents an obvious problem when a wife wishes to be divorced but her husband does not. This is a considerable problem in observant Jewish communities and has led to a variety of attempted solutions of varying acceptance and effectiveness (usually in the form of some sort of prenuptial agreement, but occasionally more creative, less legal forms).\n\nDeath. A deceased person’s body is not embalmed; rather, it is ritually washed by members of a group called the chevra kadisha (literally “holy society”), who then dress the body in a simple linen garment (tachrich), place it in a simple wooden casket (no metal, so that the body’s return to dust is hastened), and stay with the deceased while reciting psalms. At the funeral, there is no viewing. Eulogies may be given, and mourners may recite psalms (especially Psalm 23, “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want) and El Malei Rachamim (“God, full of mercy”). Cremation is forbidden, and burial should take place as soon as possible. At the burial, mourners take turns shoveling dirt into the grave, but do not pass the shovel directly to one another. A common myth states that having a tattoo prevents one from being buried in a Jewish cemetery; though Judaism discourages tattoos, that is not true. Proper treatment of the dead is considered a critical mitzvah (both commandment and good deed) because the beneficiary (the deceased person) cannot offer repayment or express gratitude.\n\nMourning commences immediately upon hearing of a death, when one traditionally recites a blessing that translates to “Blessed are you, Lord our God, king of the Universe, the judge of truth” (“…dayan ha-emet”) and one may tear their clothes. (The latter tradition is sometimes echoed with mourners wearing a ribbon at a funeral, which they ritually tear.) After burial, shiva begins—a seven-day period of mourning (colloquially in English, “sitting shiva”) during which the family of the deceased person receives visitors at home, shares recollections of the deceased, prays communally, and eats traditional comfort foods (e.g., eggs, whose round shape recalls the cycle of life). Mourners minimize vanity (keeping personal grooming to a minimum, covering mirrors, not wearing fancy clothes such as those involving leather) and avoid joyous events. A period of less intense mourning, shloshim (literally, “thirty”) lasts 30 days after burial, during which mourners continue avoiding joyous events, and specifically in the case of people mourning a parent, a less intense period of mourning lasts a year following the death. Mourners recite kaddish yatom (colloquially just kaddish), a prayer praising God but containing no direct reference to death, throughout the mourning period. On each (Hebrew-calendar) anniversary of a death, family members light a yahrzeit candle, which burns for 24 hours in memory of the deceased.\n\nConversion. A non-Jewish person who wishes to become Jewish may do so with the guidance and approval of a beit din, a Jewish court. Judaism does not seek converts; in fact, it is traditional for a rabbi to refuse a prospective convert three times, and only if they still persist should the rabbi take them as a student. A ger (convert) must study Judaism and explain their motivation to the satisfaction of the beit din, and must immerse in a mikveh (ritual bath). Men must also be circumcised, or if they were already circumcised, a drop of blood must be taken from the penis as a symbolic circumcision (hatafah dam brit). Different Jewish movements have different views on conversion, and some movements will not recognize conversions performed by rabbis from other movements. Conversion may be sought by gentiles wishing to marry a Jewish person, children raised as Jews but who are not technically Jewish (e.g., because their father is Jewish but their mother is not), or simply people who find Judaism attractive for other reasons."

    "title": "New-year Celebrations",
    "content": "The Times Square Ball Drop was first held on December 31, 1907. The ball begins dropping atop the One Times Square building at 11:59 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, and completes its downward journey at the stroke of midnight, accompanied by an audiovisual celebration. The Time Square ball drop was conceptualized by Adolph Ochs, who owned and published the New York Times, and who had previously organized midnight fireworks displays. The first Times Square ball was made of wood and iron and utilized 100 incandescent bulbs; the modern ball includes over 32,000 LED lights. The ball drop is traditionally followed by the playing of “Auld Lang Syne” and “New York, New York”; in a more recent addition to the ceremony, John Lennon’s song “Imagine” is sung at five minutes to midnight.\n\nRosh HaShanah is the Jewish new year. Rosh HaShanah falls on the first day of the Jewish month of Tishrei (though in many communities it is celebrated for the first two days), the first month of the Jewish calendar, and begins a ten-day period known as the High Holy Days, which concludes with Yom Kippur. Because of differences between the Gregorian and Jewish calendar, Rosh HaShanah may fall anywhere between September 5 and October 5. Rosh HaShanah services often include 100 soundings of the shofar, or ram’s horn, and in many communities people may gather by bodies of water to perform the ritual of tashlikh, or the casting off of sins (represented by breadcrumbs or the like) into water. A popular treat on Rosh HaShanah is apples dipped in honey, symbolizing hopes for a sweet and pleasant year. There are actually several other notions of the new year in Judaism; most notably, Nissan is often considered the first month because that is the month in which the exodus from Egypt took place, and the holiday Tu B’Sh’vat is considered the new year for trees.\n\nThe Chinese New Year is a lengthy celebration of the incoming year that traditionally lasts for 15 days. The Chinese calendar is a lunar calendar, and the first day of the first month falls on the first new moon of late January or early February. It is traditional in China for people to travel home to their families to celebrate the new year; this period of travel, known as Chunyun, involves nearly 400 million people. On the New Year, children are often given red envelopes containing money by their older, married relatives; one folk origin of this tradition involves the glimmer of coins scaring away a demon. Chinese New Year celebrations conclude on the 15th day of the year with the Lantern Festival, in which (usually red) paper lanterns with riddles written on the side are lit.\n\nNowruz is the Persian or Iranian New Year celebration. Nowruz—derived from the Persian language term for “new day”—is generally celebrated on March 21 to coincide with the vernal equinox and has its roots in Zoroastrian celebrations of the return of spring. Traditional preparations for Nowruz include gathering water to fill all available vessels in a household, as a sign of abundance. Among the best known of Nowruz traditions is the Haft Sin, a table setting of seven dishes—including sprouts, apples, and olives—each of which begins with the same letter in Persian. Mythologically, Nowruz is connected with the legendary Persian king Jamshid, who is said to have flown through the sky in a chariot on the holiday.\n\nTết Nguyên Đán, generally shortened to Tết, is the Vietnamese New Year celebration. Tết, like the Chinese New Year, has a moveable date in the Gregorian calendar, as it is based on the observation of the new moon. The first three days of Tết involve traditions of visitation: it is a widely held belief that the first visitor to a house in the new year will determine a family’s luck for the remainder of the year, so a family will selectively invite their ritual first guest of the year to ensure good fortune. On the second and third days of Tết, people traditionally visit friends and teachers, respectively. Traditional foods for Tết include bánh chung, a rice cake legendarily invented by a Hung prince to win the throne. In the West, Tết is often associated with the Tết Offensive, a major 1968 North Vietnamese attack during the Vietnam War.\n\nHogmanay is the Scottish New Year celebration, with festivities traditionally beginning on New Year’s Eve (per the Gregorian calendar). The origin of the name “Hogmanay” is unclear, though it may derive from “hoginane,” a French word meaning “gala day.” Hogmanay traditions include the ringing of bells to ring in the new year, and the collective singing of “Auld Lang Syne”—a tradition that spread to many other Western cultures. Many locations hold fire parades to celebrate Hogmanay, including the coastal village of Stonehaven, where groups of men swing fireballs over their heads. “First footing” is the Hogmanay tradition of welcoming a first visitor of the year, who is said to bring great luck if he is tall, dark-haired, and handsome. Visitors are expected to bring gifts of dark rye bread and coal, the latter symbolizing warmth.\n\nShogatsu (New Year, January 1) and Koshogatsu (Little New Year, January 15) are Japanese New Year celebrations. In 1873 Japan switched from a lunar calendar to the Gregorian calendar following the Meiji Restoration and began to observe New Year festivities on January 1. Shogatsu traditions include watching the year’s first sunrise (known as hatsuhinode) and making the year’s first visit to a shrine (known as hatsumode). At the moment of the new year, Japanese Buddhist temples traditionally ring their bells 108 times to drive away worldly temptation. Foods eaten on New Years include pounded rice cakes known as mochi and a chicken soup called ozouni. The “Little New Year” on January 15 may involve the taking down of New Year’s decorations, fire festivals, and preparation of a gruel made with azuki beans and rice.\n\nSongkran, also commonly known as the “Water Festival,” is a traditional New Year’s celebration in Thailand. Songkran is celebrated from April 13 to 15 and coincides with the astrological progression into Aries. Songkran celebrations usually include a ritual ceremony at the Wat Pho Temple in Bangkok, which is home to a massive reclining Buddha statue. The festival gets its popular name from the tradition of people sprinkling and splashing water on each other to wash away the past year, which developed into large festive water fights, in part to relieve the April heat (though these have been more tightly regulated in recent years). Many other Southeast Asian nations celebrate a water festival at the same time as Songkran, including Myanmar (Thingyan), Laos (Pi Mai), and Cambodia (Chaul Chnam Thmey).\n\nThe Junkanoo is a festive, competitive street parade held in the Bahamas on both New Year’s Day and Boxing Day (January 1 and December 26). The festival—whose name may come from John Canoe, an 18th-century chief of the West African Ahanta people—likely originates from the celebrations of enslaved people who were given respite around Christmas. The main Junkanoo parade is a massive procession down Bay Street in Nassau. In the procession, groups that may number in the hundreds perform traditional folk music and dance while dressed in elaborate costumes; the performing groups in the parade compete with one another for prizes. Junkanoo parades are known for beginning in the middle of the night, with many of them starting at around 2 to 3 a.m. and continuing until nearly noon.\n\nThe Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl Game are held annually in Pasadena, California on January 1 (though they are held on January 2 if New Year’s Day is a Sunday). The first Rose Parade was staged by the Valley Hunt Club in 1890 as a way to flaunt California’s mild winter weather. Today, the parade is known for extravagant floats covered in elaborate floral designs. The Rose Bowl Game was first played as the “Tournament East–West” game in 1902, with the University of Michigan defeating Stanford 49–0. Traditionally, the game pits the champion of the Big 10 Conference against the champion of the Pac-12 Conference, although variations in this matchup occur when the Rose Bowl is used as a College Football Playoff semifinal game, or if one of the conference champions is playing in another CFP game."

    "content": "The Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841) by Edgar Allan Poe. This story marks the debut of C. Auguste Dupin, the predecessor of many future literary genius detectives. The unnamed narrator begins by musing on the unique mental challenges presented by the games of chess and whist, and then recalls how Dupin was once able to practically read the narrator’s mind regarding an actor named Chantilly. Both the narrator and Dupin then read newspaper accounts of the murders of two women; the daughter was strangled and stuffed up a chimney, while the mother had her throat slashed so deep by a razor (also found at the scene) that her head falls off when she is moved. Neighbors testify they heard two voices but one was unidentifiable. Bags of money at the scene lead to the arrest of local banker Le Bon; Dupin deduces that, because the money remains, Le Bon is innocent and robbery is not the motive. Offering his services to a police prefect known as “G,” Dupin notes the extreme strength required of both murders, the odd language, and tufts of hair. He realizes the murderer was non-human and places a newspaper ad for a missing orangutan. A sailor confesses to the crime: he bought an orangutan in Borneo but could not control it, and when he got angry that the orangutan grabbed the razor and mimicked the sailor’s daily shave, the orangutan ran off in a bestial rage and killed the two women.\n\nThe Purloined Letter (1844) by Edgar Allan Poe. The police prefect “G” asks for Dupin’s help regarding a devious official known as “Minister D.” G believes the minister stole a letter that contains potential blackmail fodder regarding an unnamed but powerful man, and thus a huge reward is offered. However, the police cannot find the letter in Minister D’s lodgings or on his person. One month later, “G” contacts Dupin again after the reward increases to 50,000 francs; Dupin asks for the reward immediately and amazingly produces the letter. Dupin, using a metaphor about a map game—in which players tasked with finding a name on a map can easily overlook large-print names—says Minister D hid the letter in plain sight, putting it amongst a bundle on the mantle. Once hearing of the theft, Dupin went to the apartment, located the letter, and then created a diversion so he could swap the letter with a taunting fake.\n\nThe Moonstone (1868) by Wilkie Collins. Rachel Verinder’s 18th birthday party is marred by the theft of the Moonstone, a sacred gem plundered from India that Rachel had just inherited. Suspicion falls on a trio of Indian jugglers, but also on Rachel herself, who behaves oddly and breaks off her engagement with Franklin Blake when Franklin leads the search. The maid Rosanna Spearman is also suspected, especially after she commits suicide by jumping into quicksand. Local inspector Sergeant Cuff cannot solve the mystery, but one year later, Franklin returns from abroad and learns that Rosanna, who was secretly in love with him, began impeding the investigation after a paint smudge made her suspect he was the thief. Franklin then meets with Rachel, who claims she saw Franklin steal the Moonstone but never told anyone to save their reputations. Eventually, Franklin learns that he was secretly fed laudanum at the party by Dr. Candy, and while in a drugged stupor took the Moonstone to protect it. The Moonstone later turns up for sale, upon which it is stolen by the trio of Indians. The Indians also kill the seller, who is revealed to be Godfrey Ablewhite, another party guest whose personal debts prompted him to keep the Moonstone when the drugged Franklin gave it to him. Other characters who narrate portions of the book include Miss Drusilla Clack, an Evangelical who constantly hands out moralizing tracts; Gabriel Betteredge, a servant obsessed with Robinson Crusoe; and Dr. Candy’s opium-addicted assistant Ezra Jennings, an odd man with multi-colored hair.\n\nThe Final Problem (1893) by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The Sherlock Holmes stories made Doyle a celebrity, but Doyle, feeling cheapened by the work, decided to kill off Holmes in this story. The story begins with Watson welcoming in a bleeding Holmes, who recounts that Professor Moriarty—Holmes’s alleged archnemesis, despite first appearing in this story—has just tried to kill Holmes via a staged car accident, a falling brick, and an armed thug. Holmes plans to go to Europe to defeat Moriarty without alerting him; however, despite Holmes disguising himself as an Italian priest and giving Watson circuitous instructions, Moriarty tails them by rail, though Holmes and Watson evade him. In Strasbourg, Holmes learns that Scotland Yard has busted Moriarty’s organization but have failed to catch the man himself, leading Holmes to continue to Switzerland. During a hike to the Reichenbach Falls, a messenger tells Watson that a sick woman at their hotel needs a doctor; Holmes knows this is a trap laid by Moriarty but says nothing. Finding no such woman, Watson rushes back to the falls, where footprints and signs of a struggle convince him that Moriarty found Holmes and, during a fight, both fatally tumbled over the waterfall.\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles (1902) by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This novel was the first Holmes story to appear after “The Final Problem.” Holmes is solicited by James Mortimer, whose friend Charles Baskerville recently died in terror, with nearby canine footprints consistent with a myth about a hellish hound who kills Baskerville heirs. The next heir, Henry, is almost shot by a bearded pursuer in London, leading Holmes to send Watson to Baskerville Hall to protect Henry while he investigates. At the estate on the moors, Watson learns that two neighbors, the Stapleton siblings, are behaving oddly, as are the Baskerville servants, the Barrymores, and Laura Lyons, the woman Charles was supposed to meet the night of his death. Watson learns that Mr. Barrymore is skulking around to secretly aid his brother, an escaped convict, and discovers through Laura that a shadowy figure walking the moors at night is actually Holmes, laying low. Holmes discovers that Laura was used by Jack Stapleton to lure Charles onto the moors, where Stapleton—a distant heir of the Baskervilles—killed Charles with his huge pet dog. Holmes and Watson then use Henry as bait; the ruse works, and they kill Stapleton’s dog, who has been painted with phosphorus to appear spectral. Stapleton drowns in the Grimpen Mire while fleeing, and Holmes and Watson learn Stapleton’s supposed “sister” is actually his wife, who refused to help her villainous husband.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1930) by Dashiell Hammett. This classic of the “hard-boiled” genre follows Sam Spade, a San Francisco private eye hired by “Ms. Wonderly” to tail Floyd Thursby, with whom her sister has eloped. The next day, Sam’s partner Miles Archer is found dead, shot by Thursby, who is also dead. The cops suspect Spade, who is sleeping with Archer’s wife. Spade learns that “Ms. Wonderly” is actually Brigid O’Shaughnessy, a woman hunting for a priceless statuette called the Maltese Falcon alongside the obese Caspar Gutman and a homosexual Middle Easterner named Joel Cairo. At a private meeting in which Gutman explains how Brigid, Thursby, and Cairo found the Falcon in Constantinople, Spade suddenly faints, having been drugged by Gutman. Spade returns to his office, where a ship captain gives him a package containing the falcon, then dies. Brigid calls, urgently requesting Spade’s help, but Spade returns home only to find Brigid, Gutman, and Cairo waiting, demanding the Falcon. Spade reminds them that one of them will be pegged for the murders, and they turn on each other. Gutman decides his bodyguard, Wilmer, will be the patsy, but when they discover the Falcon is a fake, Wilmer escapes. Cairo and Gutman leave to find the real Falcon, but Spade doesn’t let Brigid go, certain she cannot be trusted. She confesses she shot both Archer and Thursby but is in love with Spade; Spade, refusing to “play the sap” for her, turns her over to the cops, who report that Wilmer has just murdered Gutman. The novel’s 1941 film adaptation, starring Humphrey Bogart, is considered a film noir masterpiece.\n\nThe Big Sleep (1939) by Raymond Chandler. Wealthy patriarch General Sternwood hires private eye Philip Marlowe to help his daughter Carmen, who is being blackmailed by bookseller Arthur Geiger. Sternwood also worries about Regan, his daughter Vivian’s missing husband. Pretending to be a gay book collector, Marlowe learns that Geiger’s bookstore is a pornography front, and after staking out Geiger’s home, he hears gunshots and sees two cars speeding away. Geiger is dead, and Carmen Sternwood is naked and drugged in front of a camera from which the film has been taken. The next day, Sternwood’s chauffeur is found dead in a car driven off a pier. Marlowe meets with Joe Brody, who is taking over Geiger’s bookstore, when Carmen busts in with a gun, demanding the photographs in Brody’s possession. Marlowe forces her to leave, then learns the chauffeur killed Geiger to protect Carmen from disrepute; Brody, also spying on Geiger that night, pursued and killed the chauffeur. Geiger’s homosexual lover then arrives and kills Brody, thinking Brody killed Geiger. With the case seemingly solved, Marlowe still wonders about Vivien’s missing husband Regan, as well as the missing wife of Eddie Mars, a criminal who backed Geiger’s business. Carmen and Vivien each try to seduce Marlowe while Marlowe investigates those disappearances. On returning to Sternwood’s house, Carmen asks Marlowe to teach her to shoot; at the lesson, she tries to shoot Marlowe, but Marlowe put blanks in the gun. This proves Marlowe’s theory: Carmen is a nymphomaniac who killed Regan when he spurned her advances. Vivien admits she hid the body and lied to save her father from shame, and she promises to put Carmen in an asylum.\n\nMurder on the Orient Express (1934) by Agatha Christie. This novel features Christie’s popular Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, who is snowbound on the title train in the Balkans when a passenger named Samuel Ratchett is found stabbed to death. Thanks to a scrap of paper in Ratchett’s compartment referencing “little Daisy Armstrong,” Poirot realizes Ratchett is actually Lanfranco Cassetti, a man who was acquitted on technicality of kidnapping and murder (a crime inspired by the real-life kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh’s baby). Poirot discovers that all the passengers—including former Russian princess Natalia Dragomiroff—are concealing their pasts and each had a motive to kill Cassetti, and Poirot correctly deduces that all of them stabbed Cassetti. However, Poirot’s alternate theory, that a stranger entered the snowbound train and randomly killed Ratchett, is the one presented to local authorities.\n\nAnd Then There Were None (1940) by Agatha Christie. This novel is an example of a “country house mystery,” a genre popularized by Christie in which possible suspects are limited due to the crime’s isolated locale. The novel concerns ten murderers who have escaped justice and who are invited to an island mansion. After a mysterious record accuses each guest of their crimes, they begin turning up dead one by one. Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard are the final two survivors; Vera, suspecting Philip of being the killer, shoots him dead, then returns to her room and hangs herself. The novel ends with a fisherman recovering a message in a bottle written by Justice Wargrave, one of the victims, who confesses he orchestrated all the killings in the name of “true justice.” The novel was previously published under the title Ten Little Indians and an even earlier title that included a racial slur and was taken from a popular minstrel song whose lyrics—which allude to each victim’s death—are framed and hung in the mansion’s bedrooms.\n\nThe Name of the Rose (1980) by Umberto Eco. This mystery is set in 1327 at a Catholic conference to resolve a potential heresy. William of Baskerville and his novice, Adso of Melk, are tasked with investigating the death of the comical manuscript artist Adelmo. The abbey’s librarian, Malachi, bars the two men from entering a mysterious, labyrinthine library, so they meet with Jorge of Burgos, a blind monk who hates laughter. The next day, after the monk Venantius is found dead in a vat of pig blood, William and Adso find that both victims had sought out a book from a secret room called the Finis Africae. Upon breaking into the labyrinth, they find odd writings left by Venantius; later, the monks discover that Venantius’s fingers and tongue were stained black. Eventually, William and Adso realize the letters above rooms in the library spell out regions of the world, and they locate the Finis Africae behind a mirror. As the conference ramps up, a monk named Severinus tells William about an odd book in his own library, but he is murdered before he can say more and the book goes missing. On the sixth day, Malachi is killed; his tongue and fingers are also black. On the final day of the conference, William and Adso enter the Finis Africae and find Jorge of Burgos within. Severinus’s secret book is a sequel to Aristotle’s Poetics, whose thoughts on comedy will undermine Christianity. Jorge poisoned the pages, knowing any reader would lick his fingers to turn them. Jorge then eats the manuscript, killing himself, but not before using Adso’s lantern to set the library ablaze. William and Adso escape."

    "content": "James Baldwin (1924–1987) grew up in Harlem, which he portrayed in his first novel Go Tell It on the Mountain. That novel is about the teenage John Grimes and his fanatically religious stepfather Gabriel. In Baldwin’s novel Giovanni’s Room, an American named David has an affair with the title Italian bartender. His novel If Beale Street Could Talk, about the love between Tish and a man named Fonny who has been falsely accused of rape, was made into a 2018 movie directed by Barry Jenkins. Baldwin also wrote several essays, including an examination of race and religion in The Fire Next Time. His essay collection Notes of a Native Son begins with “Everybody’s Protest Novel,” which is critical of Uncle Tom’s Cabin and Native Son.\n\nGwendolyn Brooks (1917–2000) became the first African-American person to win a Pulitzer in 1950 for her poetry collection Annie Allen. Many of her works reflect her experiences in Bronzeville, a neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side that became a center of African-American life during the Great Migration. Her best-known poem, “We Real Cool,” is set at the Golden Shovel and consists of three-word sentences starting with “We,” such as “We / Lurk late” and “We / Jazz June.” Though primarily a poet, Brooks also wrote the novel Maud Martha.\n\nRalph Ellison (1919–1994) is best known for his novel Invisible Man, whose unnamed narrator earns a college scholarship by participating in a degrading Battle Royal; after being kicked out of college and working at the Liberty Paint company (known for its pure white paint), he joins a political group called the Brotherhood. At the climax of the novel, the narrator is nearly lynched by a Black nationalist named Ras the Destroyer during riots in Harlem. Ellison’s unfinished second novel was published posthumously in a long version called Three Days Before the Shooting… and a short version called Juneteenth.\n\nLorraine Hansberry (1930–1965) is best known for her play A Raisin in the Sun. That play is about the Younger family, who debate how to use $10,000 in life insurance money. Walter wants to invest the money in a liquor store, while his mother Mama wants to buy a house in the white neighborhood Clybourne Park. Mama’s daughter Beneatha wants to spend the money on medical school and, unlike the other members of the family, explores her African heritage. Hansberry’s other works include the play The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window and the autobiography To Be Young, Gifted and Black.\n\nLangston Hughes (1901–1967) was a leading poet of the Harlem Renaissance. His poems “I, Too” and “Let America Be America Again” address America’s racist history and the feelings of exclusion it causes. His poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” invokes world rivers like the Euphrates and the Congo and repeats the line “My soul has grown deep like the rivers,” while his poem “The Weary Blues” describes a blues performance on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. He also wrote the poem “Harlem,” which asks “What happens to a dream deferred?” and which inspired the title of Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun.\n\nZora Neale Hurston (1891–1960) set many of her works in her hometown of Eatonville, Florida. Her best-known novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, is about Janie Crawford, whose sexual awakening is compared to the blossoming of a pear tree. Janie successively marries Logan Killicks, Jody Starks, and Tea Cake; when Tea Cake attacks her after being bitten by a rabid dog during a hurricane, she shoots him. Hurston was also a prominent anthropologist, collecting African-American folklore in books like Mules and Men. Her work was relatively unknown until 1975, when Alice Walker published the article “In Search of Zora Neale Hurston.”\n\nToni Morrison (1931–2019) was the first Black woman to win a Nobel Prize in Literature and won a Pulitzer for her novel Beloved. Beloved is about Sethe, a slave who escaped from Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky to 124 Bluestone Road in Cincinnati. Sethe is haunted by the ghost of Beloved, a daughter she killed to prevent her from being returned to slavery. Morrison’s first novel, The Bluest Eye, is about Pecola Breedlove, a Black foster child who considers herself ugly and wishes she had blue eyes. Morrison’s other acclaimed novels include Song of Solomon, about the life of Macon Dead III, who is nicknamed “Milkman” because he is breastfed by his mother for a long time.\n\nAlice Walker (1944–) won a National Book Award and a Pulitzer for her novel The Color Purple, whose protagonist, Celie, is repeatedly raped by her father, producing the children Olivia and Adam, both of whom are immediately taken away by her father. Celie deals with her trauma by writing letters to God. Celie marries Mister, who also abuses her; she has an affair with Shug Avery, a blues singer who is also Mister’s mistress. Walker’s short story “Everyday Use” is about the cultural differences between Dee and Maggie, the two daughters of a Southern woman known as Mama.\n\nPhillis Wheatley (1753–1784) was born in Africa and brought to the United States as a slave in 1761; Wheatley was her slave name. She was freed in the 1770s shortly after the release of her collection Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral. Her poem “On Being Brought from Africa to America” says that “mercy” brought her from her “Pagan land” and taught her “benighted soul” about God and Christian redemption. She praised George Washington in her poem “To His Excellency General Washington.”\n\nRichard Wright (1908–1960) wrote the 1940 bestseller Native Son. The protagonist of that novel, Bigger Thomas, gets a job as a chauffeur for Mary Dalton, but he suffocates her with a pillow for fear of being discovered in bed with her. Bigger later rapes and murders his girlfriend Bessie, and is ultimately sentenced to death for the murders. Wright’s memoir Black Boy describes his youth in the Jim Crow South and his move to Chicago, where he joins and then becomes disillusioned with the Communist Party. Wright also wrote Uncle Tom’s Children, a collection of novellas including “Big Boy Leaves Home” and “Fire and Cloud.”"

    "title": "Roman Emperors",
    "content": "Augustus (63 BC–AD 14, reigned 27 BC–AD 14) was the first Roman emperor. Born Gaius Octavius, he was the grandnephew and heir of Julius Caesar. After Caesar was assassinated, Octavian formed the Second Triumvirate with Marc Antony and Marcus Lepidus to defeat Caesar’s assassins. With the help of Marcus Agrippa, he sidelined Lepidus and defeated Antony at the Battle of Actium to seize the empire. Ruling as princeps, or first citizen, Augustus created the Praetorian Guard and added Egypt to the empire, but halted expansion into Germania after a crushing defeat at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest.\n\nTiberius (42 BC–AD 37, reigned AD 14–37) was Augustus’s stepson. During his father’s reign, Tiberius led the conquests of Pannonia and Raetia in central Europe and became the imperial heir with the support of his mother Livia. Unhappy as emperor, he mostly resided in his island villa on Capri and left Lucius Sejanus to manage the state. However, when Sejanus attempted to seize power in AD 31, Tiberius had him arrested and executed. Tiberius was emperor when Jesus of Nazareth was crucified around AD 33.\n\nCaligula (AD 12–AD 41, reigned AD 37–41) was the son of Germanicus, Tiberius’s popular nephew, and earned the nickname “Caligula,” or little boot, from his father’s soldiers. Though initially moderate, Caligula became increasingly tyrannical, supposedly trying to build a palace on Lake Nemi and to make his horse, Incitatus, a consul. In AD 41, Cassius Chaerea led a conspiracy of senators and Praetorian guards that killed Caligula and his immediate family.\n\nClaudius (10 BC–AD 54, reigned AD 41–54) was Caligula’s uncle. A noted scholar, he was the last person able to read ancient Etruscan. He oversaw the conquest of Britain and centralized power through a bureaucracy featuring talented freedmen like Tiberius Narcissus. In AD 49, Claudius married his niece Agrippina the Younger, who then poisoned both Claudius’s son Britannicus and the Emperor himself.\n\nNero (AD 37–AD 68, reigned AD 54–68) was the son of Agrippina the Younger. Nero provoked scandal by performing as an actor and musician. He ordered his mother’s death in AD 58, and ordered the deaths of Seneca the Younger and several others after the Pisonian Conspiracy. Nero supposedly “fiddled” during the Great Fire of Rome and persecuted Christians after it. In AD 68, he was deposed by the Senate and committed suicide.\n\nTrajan (AD 53–AD 117, reigned AD 98–117) led Rome to its greatest territorial extent. After succeeding Nerva, Trajan defeated Decebalus to conquer the rich Kingdom of Dacia (modern-day Romania). He employed Apollodorus of Damascus to build Trajan’s Column and Trajan’s Bridge across the Danube. Near the end of his reign, Trajan invaded the Parthian Empire, sacking its capital of Ctesiphon and annexing Armenia and Mesopotamia.\n\nHadrian (76–138, reigned 117–138) was Trajan’s younger cousin who succeeded him as emperor. At the start of his reign, he withdrew from Trajan’s conquests in the east. While traveling in Greece, he joined the Eleusinian Mysteries; while visiting Egypt, his beloved companion Antinous drowned in the Nile. He also commissioned Hadrian’s Wall to mark the border of Roman Britain and crushed the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judea.\n\nMarcus Aurelius (121–180, reigned 161–180) was the last of Rome’s “Five Good Emperors.” With Lucius Verus, Marcus inherited the throne from his uncle Antoninus Pius and secured a decisive victory over the Parthian Empire. Marcus then spent much of his reign dealing with the Antonine Plague and fighting the Marcomannic Wars. During this time he wrote the Meditations, a journal and major text of Stoic philosophy.\n\nDiocletian (244–305, reigned 284–305) stabilized the empire after the Crisis of the Third Century. He took power by defeating Carinus at the Battle of the Margus before creating the Tetrarchy, a new system of imperial rule with two senior emperors and two junior emperors. He unsuccessfully attempted to curb inflation with his Edict on Maximum Prices and led the last and largest persecution of Christians. In 305, he became the first emperor to voluntarily step down, retiring to his palace in Split, Croatia.\n\nConstantine (272–335, reigned 306–335) was the son of Constantius Chlorus, one of the junior members of Diocletian’s Tetrarchy. Proclaimed emperor by his father’s men, Constantine defeated Maxentius at the Battle of Milvian Bridge to seize Italy and then defeated his brother-in-law Licinius to win the east. He proposed the Edict of Milan giving tolerance to Christians and oversaw the Christian Council of Nicea. Constantine also converted the city of Byzantium into Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire for the next 1,100 years.\n\nVespasian (AD 9–AD 79, reigned AD 69–AD 79) emerged from the Year of the Four Emperors in AD 69 to found the Flavian Dynasty, and later commissioned the Colosseum.\n\nSeptimius Severus (145–211, reigned 193–211) triumphed in the Year of the Five Emperors and founded the Severan dynasty. He was the first emperor to be born in Africa.\n\nAurelian (215–275, reigned 270–275) reconquered the territory lost during the Crisis of the Third Century by defeating Zenobia of the Palmyrene Empire and retaking Gaul and Britain.\n\nTheodosius (347–405, reigned 379–405) was the last man to rule both the eastern and western halves of the empire.\n\nRomulus Augustulus (460–507, reigned 475–476) is traditionally regarded as the last Roman emperor. He was deposed in 476 by Odoacer, marking the end of the Western Roman Empire."

    "title": "Modern Speeches",
    "content": "Ain’t I a Woman (1857) was an extemporaneous speech by abolitionist and women’s rights advocate Sojourner Truth at the Women’s Convention in Akron, Ohio. Truth, a former slave, proclaimed that she could “work as much and eat as much as a man” and “bear the lash as well” while repeatedly returning to the question “and ain’t I a woman?” Truth also remarked that, even as a woman, “nobody ever helps me into carriages” because of her race. The speech was later published and popularized by feminist Frances Dana Barker Gage.\n\nThe Gettysburg Address (1863) was delivered by Abraham Lincoln at the dedication of a cemetery on the site of the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. Delivered following Edward Everett’s two-hour dedication oration, Lincoln’s remarks ran for just two minutes. The president opened by referring to the birth of the United States “four score and seven years ago,” when the founders created a nation “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” Lincoln praised the dead of Gettysburg for giving “the last full measure of devotion” and said he hoped their sacrifice would lead to “a new birth of freedom.” Only five manuscripts of the speech exist, with the most complete draft being the Bliss Copy now kept at the White House.\n\nThe Cross of Gold speech (1896) was delivered by former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan at the 1896 Democratic National Convention in support of the “free silver” economic policy. Bryan lambasted “the idle holders of idle capital,” who benefitted from a currency based on the gold standard. Instead, Bryan supported bimetallism as a way to make “the masses prosperous.” At the end of the speech, he dismissed the gold standard as a “crown of thorns” and proclaimed “You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.” The speech catapulted Bryan to prominence and helped him secure the Democratic nomination for president, though he lost the election to Republican William McKinley.\n\nThe War Speeches (1940) were a series of addresses given by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to Parliament during the Battle of France in World War II. The first speech promised “blood, toil, tears, and sweat” in the fight against Germany and stated Britain’s commitment to “victory at all costs.” The second speech described Allied losses and the evacuation at Dunkirk, acknowledging the possibility of invasion but declaring “we shall fight on the beaches” and “defend our island whatever the cost will be.” The final message came when the fall of France was imminent and claimed that the fight to come would go down as Britain’s “finest hour.”\n\nThe Jewel Voice Broadcast (1945), formally titled “The Imperial Rescript on the Termination of the War,” was a radio message by Emperor Hirohito announcing Japan’s defeat and surrender in World War II. Army officers who opposed the speech tried to destroy the recording of it the night before it aired, an attempted coup called the Kyujo Incident. In the speech, Hirohito recognized the power of America’s “new and most cruel bomb” and urged his people to “endure the unendurable” in order to save their nation. The message was written in classical Japanese, making it difficult for most Japanese citizens to understand. It was the first time the emperor directly addressed common people.\n\nThe “Tryst with Destiny” speech (1947) was delivered by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on the night of India’s independence. Speaking minutes before independence became official at midnight, Nehru celebrated that Indians will “awake to life and freedom” and laid out his vision for a nation striving toward “peace, freedom, and democracy.” Nehru also praised Mahatma Gandhi as “the Father of our Nation” and thanked him for holding “the torch of freedom” in the fight for independence.\n\nThe “Checkers” speech (1952) was a television and radio address made by Richard Nixon during the 1952 presidential election. Nixon was running for vice-president on the Republican ticket with Dwight Eisenhower, but had been accused of illegally using a campaign slush fund for personal spending. In the speech, Nixon explained his finances and argued that he never benefited from political gifts, except for a cocker spaniel named Checkers that had been given to his daughters. The speech was inspired by a 1944 speech by Franklin Roosevelt defending his dog, Fala.\n\nThe Secret Speech (1956), formally titled “On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences,” was a report given by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to the Congress of the Communist Party denouncing the regime of his predecessor, Joseph Stalin. Khrushchev specifically criticized Stalin for making his own rivals in the Communist Party and the Red Army into “enemies of the people,” as well as for glorifying himself above the party and the country. The controversial speech contributed to the split between the Soviet Union and Communist China and to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.\n\nThe “I Have a Dream” speech (1963) was delivered by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington. King began his oration by calling the promise of the Declaration of Independence a “bad check” given to African Americans and urging action “until justice rolls down like waters.” After singer Mahalia Jackson encouraged him to “tell them about the dream,” King described his vision of former slaves and slaveholders sitting “at the table of brotherhood” and of his children being judged by “the content of their character” rather than by their race. The speech concluded by proclaiming “free at last, Great God almighty, we are free at last.”\n\nI am Prepared to Die (1964) was a speech delivered by Nelson Mandela during his prosecution for terrorism charges in the Rivonia Trial. In the three-hour speech, Mandela defended his leadership of the Spear of the Nation, the militant wing of the African National Congress working to end apartheid in South Africa. At the conclusion of the speech, Mandela restated his commitment to the “struggle of the African people” and declared “I am prepared to die.” Mandela was convicted, then spent the next 27 years in prison before his release in 1990."

    "content": "Quartz is a mineral composed of Si O4 tetrahedra linked in a framework with oxygen atoms shared between neighboring tetrahedra to give an overall chemical formula of Si O2 (silicon dioxide). Inclusions of different elements give different varieties of quartz, including amethyst (purple). Quartz is the second-most abundant mineral in Earth’s crust. Quartz is often used in clocks because it exhibits piezoelectricity. Quartz defines hardness 7 on the Mohs scale.\n\nFeldspars are a group of silicate minerals that are the most abundant minerals in the Earth’s crust. Feldspars are categorized based on whether they contain potassium (orthoclase) or sodium and calcium (plagioclase). The continuous branch of Bowen’s reaction series covers the transition from calcium-rich to sodium-rich plagioclases. Orthoclase defines hardness 6 on the Mohs scale.\n\nCalcite is a stable mineral form of calcium carbonate. Less stable forms of calcium carbonate (called polymorphs), such as aragonite, eventually convert to calcite. Calcite is found in the shells of many marine organisms, including plankton, echinoderms, and bivalves. This makes calcite a major constituent of sedimentary rocks, especially limestone. Many optical devices utilize calcite because it exhibits birefringence (double refraction). Calcite defines hardness 3 on the Mohs scale.\n\nDiamond is a mineral composed of carbon atoms in a “diamond cubic” crystal structure. Among natural materials, diamond has one of the highest thermal conductivities and highest hardnesses; it defines hardness 10 on the Mohs scale. Natural diamonds are almost always found in igneous rocks called kimberlites.\n\nCorundum is a mineral composed of aluminum oxide. Common gem forms of corundum include rubies (turned red by inclusions of chromium) and sapphires (which can take a variety of colors from inclusions of iron, titanium, or vanadium). Corundum defines hardness 9 on the Mohs scale.\n\nMicas are a group of silicate minerals known for their perfect basal cleavage, meaning they can easily split into thin, parallel sheets. Common varieties of mica include black biotite and transparent muscovite. Mica is often found in igneous rocks called pegmatites and also serves as the main constituent of the metamorphic rock schist. Micas generally have a Mohs hardness between 3 and 4.\n\nBasalt is the most common igneous rock—over 90% of volcanic rocks on Earth are basalt! Basalt is mafic, meaning it is rich in magnesium and iron, and extrusive, meaning it cools and solidifies on the Earth’s surface. Lava containing gas bubbles may cool into vesicular basalt. Basalt primarily composed of vesicles is known as scoria.\n\nGranite is a common igneous rock. Granite is felsic, meaning it is primarily composed of feldspar and quartz, and intrusive, meaning it crystallizes and solidifies underground. Granite can experience large-scale weathering, leading to the formation of structures like Yosemite National Park’s Half Dome.\n\nLimestone is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of calcium carbonate. Limestone often metamorphoses into marble. Because limestone is made from carbonate minerals, it is soluble in acid, and erosion of limestone can form karst topography. Limestone is commonly used in the production of lime and cement and as a pH buffer in soil conditioners.\n\nSandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock, which means it is composed of pre-existing fragments of other rocks and minerals (usually quartz and feldspar). Common subgroups of sandstone include arkose (sandstones containing over 25% feldspar), wackes (sandstones with a large amount of clay between mineral grains), and arenites (sandstones with a small amount of clay between mineral grains). Fine-grained sandstones make good aquifers because they are porous enough to allow percolation of water but still filter out pollutants."

    "title": "African-american Civil Rights Leaders",
    "content": "Stokely Carmichael (1941–1998) was a leader of the Pan-African movement and the Black Power movement, who popularized the use of the term “Black Power.” He replaced John Lewis as chair of SNCC; under his leadership, SNCC shifted from a policy of nonviolence to a more militant approach. He served as “honorary Prime Minister” of the Black Panther Party, but later distanced himself from that movement because he didn’t believe that white activists should be allowed to participate. He ended up changing his name to Kwame Ture (in honor of Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah and Guinean President Ahmed Sekou Touré) and moving to Guinea.\n\nShirley Chisholm (1924–2005) was a Democratic politician from New York who achieved a number of firsts. In 1968, she was the first black woman elected to Congress. In 1972, she became both the first black major-party presidential candidate and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. (Margaret Chase Smith had run for the Republican nomination in 1964.) In 1970, Chisholm gave an acclaimed speech in support of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nMedgar Evers (1925–1963) was the NAACP’s field secretary for Mississippi, in which capacity he planned boycotts and grassroots civil rights organizations. He advocated ending segregation at the University of Mississippi; after Brown v. Board of Education ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, he applied to law school there, but was rejected because he was black. In 1963, he was assassinated by Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the white supremacist network White Citizens’ Councils.\n\nJesse Jackson Sr. (1941–) is a civil rights activist and politician who began as a protégé of Martin Luther King, Jr. He helped organize Operation Breadbasket, a department of the SCLC focused on economic issues. Jackson also worked on the Poor People’s Campaign after King’s assassination, but he clashed with King’s appointed successor, Ralph Abernathy. He founded the civil rights organizations Operation PUSH (People United to Save Humanity) and the National Rainbow Coalition, which later merged to form the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. He also ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988. His son Jesse Jackson Jr. was a congressman from Chicago before serving prison time for financial corruption.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. (1929–1968) was a Baptist minister and the most prominent leader of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and ’60s. He delivered the “I Have a Dream” speech at the 1963 March on Washington. As leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), he joined with members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to organize the Selma-to-Montgomery marches. His leadership of the Poor People’s Campaign was cut short in 1968 when James Earl Ray assassinated him at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis.\n\nJames Meredith (1933–) became the first African-American person admitted to the University of Mississippi in 1962. Two people died in the riots sparked by his enrollment. In 1966, Meredith began the March Against Fear, planning to walk from Memphis to Jackson. On the second day, he was wounded by a sniper; thereafter, thousands of other civil rights activists completed the march in his name.\n\nRosa Parks (1913–2005) was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955, disobeying driver James F. Blake’s order to move to the “colored section” of the bus. She collaborated with Edgar Nixon and other leaders of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) to organize the Montgomery bus boycott, which lasted from December 1955 (four days after her arrest) until December 1956.\n\nAl Sharpton (1954–) is a Baptist minister and community leader from New York City. He is also a perennial political candidate who has run for the U.S. Senate, mayor of New York City, and president of the U.S. Sharpton began his activism career working under Jesse Jackson as part of Operation Breadbasket. He has been at the center of many controversies. In 1987, he helped handle publicity for Tawana Brawley, who falsely accused four white men of having raped her. Sharpton was also accused of making anti-Semitic remarks during the 1991 Crown Heights riot, a racial riot in which Jews were attacked after two children were injured by the motorcade of the leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement.\n\nIda B. Wells (1862–1931) was an early investigative journalist and civil rights leader who helped found the NAACP. In the 1890s she investigated lynching, arguing that it was a form of controlling black communities rather than retribution for criminal acts. She documented the results of her research in pamphlets such as Southern Horrors and The Red Record. She accused Frances Willard, the president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, of turning a blind eye to lynching.\n\nMalcolm X (1925–1965) was a black Muslim civil rights activist who changed his name from Malcolm Little upon converting to the Nation of Islam. He later repudiated the Nation of Islam and became a mainstream Sunni Muslim, completing the hajj in 1964. He was known for rejecting nonviolent activism, arguing in his speech “The Ballot or the Bullet” that violence might be necessary if the government continued to suppress the rights of African Americans. In 1965, he was assassinated while preparing to give a speech at the Audubon Ballroom."

    "title": "Presidential Scandals",
    "content": "The Corrupt Bargain (1825) supposedly resolved the election of 1824 by making John Quincy Adams president. After the Democratic–Republican Party fractured before the election, four men ran for president: Adams, General Andrew Jackson, Speaker of the House Henry Clay, and Treasury Secretary William Crawford. Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote and the Electoral College, but not enough to clinch victory. As a result, the House of Representatives selected among the top three candidates and gave the White House to Adams. Jackson attributed the result to a “corrupt bargain” in which Clay used his influence in the House to boost Adams in exchange for being named Secretary of State. Most historians believe that Clay backed Adams because they shared similar views, but Jackson used the issue to unseat Adams in 1832 and win reelection against Clay in 1836. The controversy foreshadowed later battles between Jackson’s Democratic Party and Clay’s Whig Party.\n\nThe Petticoat Affair (1829–1831) disrupted the cabinet of Andrew Jackson. Secretary of War John Eaton’s wife Peggy was unpopular with the wives of Jackson’s other cabinet members, who thought she was immoral and too assertive for a woman. Led by Floride Calhoun, the wife of Vice President John C. Calhoun, they snubbed her socially and caused an obvious rift in the Jackson administration. The only cabinet member to support the Eatons was Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, who was a widower. Jackson, whose own wife Rachel had died after being targeted by negative rumors while he ran for president, supported Eaton and forced his cabinet to resign. After the scandal, Van Buren became Jackson’s heir apparent and eventual successor in the White House, while Calhoun became the president’s staunch enemy.\n\nThe Impeachment of Andrew Johnson (1868) was the first time a president was impeached. Johnson took office after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. As a former southern Democrat and opponent of civil rights for African–Americans, Johnson infuriated Republicans by blocking their Reconstruction policies. Radical Republicans responded by passing the Tenure of Office Act, which required the Senate to approve all changes to the cabinet. When Johnson violated the act by trying to remove Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, the House impeached him in March 1868. After a trial in the Senate, only 35 of the necessary 36 senators voted to remove Johnson, with Edmund Ross and nine other Republicans breaking ranks to keep him in office. Though briefly thwarted, “Radical Reconstruction” regained momentum when Ulysses Grant was elected president later in the year.\n\nThe Whiskey Ring (1871–1876) scandal tarnished the presidency of Ulysses Grant. During the 1870s, whiskey distillers, primarily in St. Louis, set up a conspiracy to bribe U.S. Treasury officials to evade taxes. The “ring” was coordinated by General John McDonald, a federal revenue collector, and backed by Grant’s private secretary Orville Babcock. In 1875 the reform-minded Treasury Secretary Benjamin Bristow exposed the conspiracy and helped secure the convictions of over 100 people. The Whiskey Ring, alongside other controversies like the Star Route scandal, tarnished Grant’s reputation, though historians are unsure about how much the president knew about corruption around him.\n\nThe Pinchot–Ballinger Affair (1909–1910) split the Republican Party over conservation issues during the presidency of William Howard Taft. After succeeding his friend Theodore Roosevelt as president, Taft controversially appointed Richard Ballinger as Secretary of the Interior. The appointment was seen as a reversal of Roosevelt’s progressive conservation policies. In office, Ballinger began returning private lands to private use and clashed with Louis Glavis of the General Land Office and Gifford Pinchot, the head of the U.S. Forest Service. When Glavis and Pinchot accused Ballinger of corruption, Taft fired them. Although an investigation cleared Ballinger of wrongdoing, the scandal led Roosevelt to break from Taft and run for president with the Progressive Party in 1912, which enabled Democrat Woodrow Wilson to win the White House.\n\nThe Teapot Dome scandal (1921–1929) was a major controversy during the presidency of Warren G. Harding and was considered the most damaging presidential scandal ever to that point. Harding’s Secretary of the Interior, Albert Fall, leased Navy oil reserves at Teapot Dome, Wyoming to private companies at low rates. The leasing of the reserves was not illegal, but allegations arose that Fall had taken bribes from oil tycoons like Edward Doheny. A long-running investigation by Senator Thomas Walsh uncovered proof of Fall’s corruption, and in 1929, he became the first former cabinet member to go to prison. During the scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in McGrain v. Daugherty that Congress could compel testimony by issuing subpoenas. The full extent of the scandal was not revealed until well after Harding’s sudden death in office in 1923.\n\nThe Watergate scandal (1972–1974) became the biggest presidential scandal of all time by forcing Richard Nixon to resign as president. During the 1972 election, burglars were caught breaking into Democratic headquarters at the Watergate building in D.C. Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein investigated the case, receiving tips from an anonymous source called “Deep Throat” (later revealed to be deputy FBI director Mark Felt). The reporters linked the break-in to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CREEP). Sam Ervin led televised Senate hearings on the scandal while Archibald Cox investigated as a special prosecutor. Nixon fired Cox in the Saturday Night Massacre and tried to hide incriminating recordings that showed his role in a cover-up. When the Supreme Court ordered the recordings to be released, Nixon resigned before he could be impeached. He was pardoned by his successor Gerald Ford in 1974. Watergate caused a lasting drop in public trust in government, and the suffix “-gate” is often used to name major scandals in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Iran–Contra scandal (1985–1987) rocked Ronald Reagan’s second term. Reagan’s administration wanted to send aid to a right-wing rebel group in Nicaragua, the Contras, who were fighting the socialist Sandinista government. However, Congress had prohibited sending aid through the Boland Amendment. To circumvent that restriction, Reagan officials secretly sold arms to Iran as part of a deal to free hostages in Lebanon and diverted some of the proceeds to the Contras. The effort was overseen by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council. The Tower Commission and independent counsel Lawrence Walsh investigated the scandal, indicting North and officials like Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. The investigations did not find proof directly implicating Reagan in the scandal.\n\nThe Monica Lewinsky scandal (1995–1999) led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton. In 1995 Clinton began an affair with Lewinsky, a White House intern. Lewinsky’s friend Linda Tripp revealed the affair to Kenneth Starr, the special prosecutor investigating Clinton’s controversial Whitewater land deal. Clinton had denied the affair publicly and to a grand jury, leading Starr to accuse him of perjury. The House of Representatives, led by Republican Newt Gingrich, impeached Clinton in 1998, but the Senate did not come close to removing him from office. However, Clinton was fined for contempt of court and briefly lost his law license.\n\nThe Plame Affair (2003) roiled George W. Bush’s presidency amid his invasion of Iraq. Valerie Plame was a covert CIA officer married to Joseph Wilson, a diplomat who had been sent to Africa to investigate reports that Saddam Hussein was trying to purchase uranium (a key justification for the invasion). Soon after Wilson wrote an op-ed disputing that Hussein was trying to buy uranium, journalist Robert Novak wrote a column about Wilson that identified Plame as a CIA agent. Critics claimed that the Bush administration had leaked Plame’s identity as payback for Wilson’s article. No one was convicted for leaking the information, but “Scooter” Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was sent to prison for lying to investigators."

    "title": "Arthurian Characters",
    "content": "King Arthur, “The Once and Future King,” was the son of Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. Uther disguised himself as Igraine’s husband Gorlois to sleep with her. Arthur wields the legendary sword Excalibur and rules the Britons from the castle of Camelot beside his wife, Queen Guinevere. The stories of Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth in Historia Regnum Britanniae, works by Chrétien de Troyes, and Thomas Mallory’s Le Morte d’Arthur, among others. The different sources disagree on various details; for instance, some sources state that Arthur received Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake, while in others he pulls the sword from a stone. After the Battle of Camlann, King Arthur gives Excalibur to his marshal, Sir Bedivere, and is taken to the isle of Avalon to die.\n\nMerlin is a powerful wizard who serves as Arthur’s chief advisor. When Merlin was a child, King Vortigern was told that the boy’s blood was necessary to keep his tower from constantly collapsing; however, Merlin identified a pool beneath the tower in which two dragons fought as the source of the instability. Some sources credit Merlin with constructing the Round Table as well as Stonehenge. Merlin’s primary apprentice is the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur’s half-sister on his mother’s side. Some sources have Merlin wind up trapped in an enchanted tomb (possibly in a cave, possibly in a tree) by a figure identified as Vivien or Nimue (the Lady of the Lake). In other tales, Merlin dies and is buried in the legendary forest Brocéliande.\n\nQueen Guinevere is the daughter of Leodegrance and the wife of King Arthur. In one story, Guinevere is abducted by Meleagant (or Melwas), a king of Somerset, and rescued by Lancelot, beginning an illicit affair between the two. After the affair is revealed to Arthur (in some sources by Mordred, in others by Agravain), Arthur orders her to be burned at the stake; she is rescued from that fate by Lancelot in a battle that results in the deaths of Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris and the permanent exile of Lancelot. Some sources say that Guinevere spent her final days hiding in the Tower of London or in a nearby convent.\n\nSir Lancelot is the foremost among the Knights of the Round Table, an expert swordsman and jouster who is the primary figure of the Vulgate Cycle. The son of King Ban of Benwick, Lancelot was raised by the Lady of the Lake, which earned him the epithet “du Lac” or “of the Lake.” Another of his epithets is “Knight of the Cart,” which he earned for riding in a dwarf’s cart while searching for Guinevere after she was kidnapped. Aside from his adulterous affair with Queen Guinevere, Lancelot is known for fathering Sir Galahad with Elaine of Corbenic, who had tricked Lancelot into sleeping with her by disguising herself as Guinevere. After his betrayal of Arthur was revealed, Lancelot fled to France and was therefore not present during the Battle of Camlann.\n\nSir Galahad is a Knight of the Round Table renowned for his purity and honor. Galahad is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and King Pelles’s daughter Lady Elaine of Corbenic. Sir Galahad is the only member of Arthur’s corps who can sit in the Siege Perilous, a seat at the Round Table set aside by Merlin for the knight who would complete the quest for the Holy Grail. Galahad’s quest for the Holy Grail, which he completed alongside Sir Percival and Sir Bors, ended when he encountered the Fisher King, who asked him to take the chalice to Sarras. Galahad is supposedly descended from the brother-in-law of Joseph of Arimathea, who later visits him and allows him to ascend to Heaven.\n\nSir Percival is a Knight of the Round Table who accompanies Sir Galahad and Sir Bors on the successful quest for the Holy Grail. Percival is one of the sons of King Pellinore. He was raised in the woods by his (unnamed) mother until he turned 15. Although Percival fails to identify the Holy Grail during an early encounter with the wounded Fisher King that involved a bleeding lance, he later heals the Fisher King’s wound at the end of the quest. In some stories, Percival loves a woman named Blanchefleur, and he is named as the father of Lohengrin in many Germanic sources.\n\nSir Gawain is a Knight of the Round Table and the son of Morgause and King Lot of Orkney, making him the nephew of King Arthur. He is the hero of the Pearl Poet’s 14th-century romantic epic Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, in which Gawain’s loyalty and resolve are tested by the title Green Knight (secretly Lord Bertilak), who survives his beheading at the hands of Gawain and returns a year later to return the favor. Gawain’s brothers Gareth and Gaheris are killed during Lancelot’s rescue of Queen Guinevere, sending Gawain into a frenzy.\n\nMordred is King Arthur’s illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause (they were unaware of their shared parentage), possibly making him the rightful heir to Camelot. Mordred is best known as a traitorous figure who crowns himself King of the Britons while King Arthur is in Gaul fighting the mythical Emperor Lucius of Rome. Mordred is also frequently linked with Queen Guinevere: some accounts say that he reported the queen’s affair with Lancelot to Arthur, some say that Mordred took Guinevere as a concubine during his usurpation of Arthur’s throne, and some say that Mordred’s wife was Guinevere’s sister Gwenhwyfach. Arthur killed Mordred at the Battle of Camlann.\n\nTristan and Iseult were a pair of lovers who predate the stories of King Arthur but nonetheless appear in the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate Cycles. Sir Tristan was a knight who brings Iseult the Fair back to Cornwall to marry his uncle King Mark after killing Morholt, an Irish knight extorting the king. During the return journey, the pair ingest a powerful potion and fall deeply in love with each other, but Iseult nevertheless marries Tristan’s uncle. The love potion, however, forces the pair to continuously seek one another out, and King Mark eventually discovers their affair. Tristan escapes his execution and later marries a different woman known as Iseult of the White Hands. Their story inspired Richard Wagner’s opera Tristan und Isolde.\n\nThe Lady of the Lake is a character who goes by many other names, among them Nimue and Vivien. In many stories, the Lady of the Lake is responsible for bestowing Excalibur upon King Arthur. She also gave Merlin his powers of sorcery and raised Sir Lancelot after his father’s death. The Lady of the Lake is frequently associated with the isle of Avalon and is sometimes conflated with Morgan le Fay."

    "title": "Dwarf Planets, Comets, And Asteroids",
    "content": "Pluto (formally, 134340 Pluto), was, from its 1930 discovery until 2006, considered to be the ninth planet from the Sun. However, in 2006, it was reclassified as a dwarf planet due to its inability to clear the neighborhood of its orbit (meaning there are other bodies of comparable size that share its orbit). Pluto was discovered by 24-year-old astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who found it by looking at whether or not objects had moved in subsequent photos of the same area of the sky. Pluto was visited by NASA’s New Horizons probe (which carried Tombaugh’s ashes) in 2015; among its most striking features was a heart-shaped area in its southern hemisphere, which was christened the Tombaugh Regio. Pluto is part of the Kuiper belt, a disk of outer Solar System objects ranging from around 30–50 AU from the Sun. Pluto has five natural satellites, the largest of which is Charon.\n\nHalley’s Comet is, by far, the best-known comet. The fame of Halley’s Comet rests on two main factors: first, it has a relatively short orbital period of about 75.5 years; second, it is visible to the naked eye as it passes Earth. The comet is named after Edmond Halley (1656–1742), who observed it in 1682, determined it orbited the Sun, and correctly predicted its subsequent 1758 return in his treatise Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets. Halley’s Comet is one of the most studied and depicted astronomical objects in all of human history: Chinese reports of the comet’s appearance in 240 BC are part of the Records of the Grand Historian, and the comet appears in the sky of the Bayeux Tapestry, as it passed Earth in 1066 before the Battle of Hastings. Halley’s Comet is the source of the Orionid meteor shower.\n\nComet Hale–Bopp is an extremely long-period comet that was visible to unaided observers on Earth for 18 months, giving it the longest continuous observational period of any comet. Hale–Bopp was an extremely bright comet, reaching a peak magnitude of −1.8 (smaller numbers indicate greater luminosity). The comet was named for its American co-discoverers, Alan Hale (a professional astronomer), and Thomas Bopp (an amateur stargazer). The comet’s 1990s pass through the solar system greatly affected its orbit: a close encounter with the planet Jupiter and its gravitational pull shifted the comet’s path such that its orbital period dropped from over 4,000 years to about 2,500 years. During its visible time, astronomers discovered that Hale–Bopp had a sodium tail. Members of the Heaven’s Gate cult killed themselves in a 1997 mass suicide in an attempt to board a spaceship they believed was hidden by the comet.\n\nComet Shoemaker–Levy 9 collided with Jupiter in 1994, providing modern astronomers with their first opportunity to observe a collision between two major solar system objects. The comet was named for its co-discoverers, husband and wife Gene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy. Shoemaker–Levy 9 was discovered in 1993, when it had already been captured by Jupiter’s gravity and had passed the planet’s Roche limit, the point at which a larger body’s tidal forces become so powerful that a smaller body will break up. The comet’s fragments collided with Jupiter in July. Subsequent observations of the clouds around the impact site revealed deeper layers of Jupiter’s atmosphere never before seen; astronomers confirmed the existence of sulfur, but were disappointed by lack of evidence for a theorized layer of water clouds. Remnants of the impact were visible as disruptions in Jupiter’s atmosphere for nearly a year.\n\nComet 67P (also known as Churyumov–Gerasimenko) is a short-period comet with an orbital period of about 6.5 years. In 2014, the European Space Agency’s Rosetta probe reached the comet, ten years after it was launched in 2004. Two months after Rosetta began to orbit the comet, its Philae lander touched down on the comet’s surface on November 12, marking the first time any human spacecraft had successfully landed on a comet’s nucleus. However, an accident in the landing meant that Philae landed in a spot where it could not receive solar power, and its batteries ran out after just two days of work. Among the notable scientific discoveries from the mission are that 67P contains three times the amount of deuterium found in Earth water, that the comet is surrounded by diatomic oxygen, and that the comet’s composition includes organic chemical compounds. The comet will return to its perihelion, the closest point in its orbit to the Sun, in April 2028.\n\nCeres (formally, 1 Ceres), is the most massive object in the asteroid belt. Ceres was discovered by Giuseppe Piazzi, an Italian priest and astronomer, in 1801, making it the first asteroid belt object to be observed and documented; it was named after the Roman goddess of agriculture. The discovery of Ceres involved the collaboration of multiple scientists, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, whose calculations of Ceres’s orbital path allowed it to be found again after it was lost due to the Sun. In 2006, with the demotion of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, Ceres was also reclassified as a dwarf planet, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. In 2015, NASA’s Dawn probe reached Ceres, beginning an extended observation. Ceres’s surface features include Ahuna Mons, a cryovolcano that erupts aqueous solutions, which quickly freeze upon exposure to Ceres’s cold surface.\n\nVesta (formally, 4 Vesta) is the second-most massive object in the asteroid belt, after Ceres. Vesta was discovered by Heinrich Olbers, who also discovered the asteroid Pallas (which is approximately as large as Vesta, but less massive); it was named by Carl Friedrich Gauss after the Roman goddess of the hearth. Vesta—like Ceres—was visited by the Dawn probe, which orbited Vesta from 2011 to 2012 before leaving orbit and heading for Ceres. Notable features of Vesta include the Rheasilvia crater, an enormous impact crater whose diameter is over 90% of the diameter of Vesta itself and at whose center is a mountain over 12 miles tall. Much of what is currently known about the composition of Vesta is based on the study of HED meteorites (so named because they are classified as howardites, eucrites, or diogenites), which originated from Vesta before colliding with Earth.\n\nEris (formally, 136199 Eris) is a dwarf planet that was co-discovered in 2005 by Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz. Eris is a scattered disc object, meaning it was “scattered” out of the Kuiper belt by the gravity of Neptune, falling into a high-eccentricity orbit that ranges between 38 and 97 AU from the Sun. Upon its discovery, Eris was thought to be both larger and more massive than Pluto; later observations concluded Pluto did have a greater surface area, but was less massive. Eris’s discovery and its potential classification as another planet prompted the 2006 IAU redefinition of the term “planet” that excluded Pluto (and Eris). Eris was named after the Greek goddess of strife, in acknowledgment that its discovery had caused a great deal of strife within astronomy. Eris is orbited by the moon Dysnomia.\n\nTheia is a hypothetical solar system body that, between 4 and 5 billion years ago, collided with Earth; the debris ejected by this collision subsequently coalesced to create the Moon, a process known as the “Giant Impact Hypothesis.” Theories regarding the size of Theia vary, with some estimates placing it around the size of Mars. Evidence for the existence of Theia—and its collision with Earth—include observations of shock heating in meteorites of approximately the same age as the hypothesized impact and the fact that the Earth is much more abundant in light chlorine, while the Moon contains more heavy chlorine—a result that fits with what would be expected if two objects collided, broke apart, and re-formed. In 2021, scientists at Arizona State University proposed that the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces found in the lowest part of Earth’s mantle may be remnants of Theia. Theia is named after the mythical Greek Titaness who was the mother of the Moon goddess Selene."

    "title": "Postmodern Authors",
    "content": "Vladimir Nabokov (1899–1977) was a Russian-American author. His 1955 novel Lolita depicts Humbert Humbert’s obsession with the adolescent Ramsdale resident Dolores Haze, whom Humbert nicknames “Lolita.” Humbert becomes Lolita’s stepfather by marrying her mother Charlotte, who soon dies. Lolita and Humbert travel the U.S. before Humbert enrolls Lolita at the Beardsley School for Girls. There, Lolita is cast in a play written by Clare Quilty, and devises a plan of escape. In Nabokov’s highly meta-fictional novel Pale Fire, a 999-line poem of the same name by John Shade is the subject of a lengthy commentary by the scholar Charles Kinbote. However, Kinbote’s notes are more concerned with himself than with the poem, revealing that he thinks of himself as King Charles, the exiled monarch of the land of Zembla. Nabokov’s other books include the novels Ada, or Ardor, which recounts an incestuous relationship; Invitation to a Beheading, about the condemned prisoner Cincinnatus, and The Defense, a Russian-language novel about the chess player Aleksandr Luzhin. In his memoir Speak, Memory, Nabokov wrote about his wife Vera and his scientific interest in butterflies.\n\nJorge Luis Borges BOR-hayss (1899–1986) was an Argentine short story writer who often dealt with meta-fictional themes. His story “The Library of Babel” depicts an infinite library made up of hexagonal rooms, which contain every possible 410-page book. In “Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote,” the fictional 20th-century author Pierre Menard writes a line-by-line reproduction of Cervantes’s Don Quixote, which is much more interesting than the original because of the historical context in which the new version was produced. Borges’s story “Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius” describes an imaginary realm, created by a secret society of intellectuals, that gradually intrudes into the world of the story. “The Aleph” is named after a point from which every other point in the universe can be perceived. Many of Borges’s best-known stories appeared in the collections Ficciones and Labyrinths, the latter of which is named after a common motif in Borges’s work. For example, in “The Garden of Forking Paths” the author Ts’ui Pên tries to create a metaphorical “labyrinth” by writing a novel in which every event is followed by every possible outcome. The story is narrated by Ts’ui Pên’s descendent, Dr. Yu Tsun, who kills the Sinologist Stephen Albert to convey a coded message to German forces during World War I.\n\nKurt Vonnegut (1922–2007) was an American novelist best known for the 1969 novel Slaughterhouse-Five. The novel centers on Billy Pilgrim, who experiences his life out of order after becoming “unstuck in time.” Like Vonnegut, Billy survives the firebombing of Dresden during World War II. Billy is also kidnapped by aliens called Tralfamadorians, and displayed in a zoo along with the actress Montana Wildhack. The Tralfamadorians have a fatalistic attitude towards mortality, which is mirrored in the novel’s repetition of the phrase “so it goes” after any mention of death. Vonnegut’s earlier novel Cat’s Cradle describes a fictional religion called Bokononism, which was founded on the Caribbean island of San Lorenzo. The plot of Cat’s Cradle partly focuses on ice-nine, a substance invented by Felix Hoenikker that has the power to destroy all life on Earth.\n\nItalo Calvino (1923–1985) was an Italian author. In his 1979 novel If on a winter’s night a traveler, the even-numbered sections are presented as the first chapters of a number of different books, each of which breaks off abruptly at a climactic moment. The odd-numbered sections are addressed in the second person to “You,” the reader of “Italo Calvino’s new novel, If on a winter’s night a traveler.” You and a fellow book-lover named Ludmilla investigate oddities in the novels you are reading, in the process encountering a best-selling author named Silas Flannery, the deceitful translator Ermes Marana, and a scholar of Cimmerian literature named Professor Uzzi-Tuzii. Calvino’s novel Invisible Cities is framed as a conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, who describes 55 fictional cities to the Mongol ruler. Calvino is also known for his fantastical short stories, some of which are collected in the volume Cosmicomics and narrated by an ancient being named Qfwfq.\n\nJoseph Heller (1923–1999) was an American novelist. He satirized Army bureaucracy in his novel Catch-22, which was based on his experiences as a bombardier on the Italian front during World War II. The novel is set in Rome and on the Mediterranean island of Pianosa, where John Yossarian is stationed with the 256th Squadron. “Catch-22” is a rule stating that airmen do not have to fly missions if they are insane, but that applying to be excused from flying missions is proof of sanity; consequently, there is no way to avoid the dangerous missions. Characters in the novel include the arch-capitalist mess officer Milo Minderbinder, who sets up a syndicate called M&M Enterprises, and Major Major Major, who is accidentally promoted to the rank of major because of his unusual name. The novel’s main antagonist is Colonel Cathcart, who continually raises the number of missions that airmen must fly before they are allowed to go home. In 1994 Heller wrote a sequel to Catch-22, titled Closing Time.\n\nDon DeLillo (born 1936) is an American author. His 1985 breakout novel White Noise is narrated by Jack Gladney, a professor of “Hitler Studies” at a Midwestern college. After a chemical spill results in an “Airborne Toxic Event,” Jack’s wife Babette begins taking a mysterious drug called Dylar. Three years later DeLillo published Libra, a novel about assassin Lee Harvey Oswald’s participation in a fictional conspiracy against John F. Kennedy. DeLillo also wrote the 1997 novel Underworld, in which the waste management executive Nick Shay buys the baseball that was hit by New York Giants player Bobby Thomson in the 1951 “Shot Heard ’Round the World.”\n\nThomas Pynchon (born 1937) is a reclusive American novelist. His 1973 novel Gravity’s Rainbow follows Tyrone Slothrop, a lieutenant in World War II whose sexual encounters seem to predict the locations of future V-2 rocket strikes. A number of characters in the novel are trying to find the secret of a mysterious device called the Schwärzgerat, which is to be installed in a rocket with the serial number 00000. Pynchon also wrote The Crying of Lot 49, in which Oedipa Maas suspects that she has become entangled in an ancient conflict between the Thurn und Taxis and Trystero mail delivery services. Other Pynchon novels include V., in which Herbert Stencil searches for the mysterious title entity, and Inherent Vice, about the Los Angeles private investigator Doc Sportello.\n\nSalman Rushdie (born 1947) is a novelist born in India, who holds British and American citizenship. Rushdie’s 1981 Booker Prize-winning novel Midnight’s Children follows Saleem Sinai, a man with an enormous nose who is born at precisely the moment that India becomes independent, giving him telepathic powers. Other members of the novel’s title group—the people born within an hour of independence—include Shiva, a child with enormous knees, and the magical Parvati-the-witch. Rushdie’s 1988 novel The Satanic Verses begins as the actors Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha are miraculously saved after their plane explodes over the English Channel. Upon being betrayed by Gibreel, Saladin seeks revenge by ruining Gibreel’s relationship with the mountaineer Allie Cone. The Satanic Verses was condemned in a fatwa, or religious decree, issued by Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini. The fatwa accused Rushdie of blasphemy, and ordered Muslims to kill Rushdie, his editors, and his publishers. In 1998, Iran agreed not to actively seek Rushdie’s death. Rushdie described his years of hiding in the memoir Joseph Anton; the title refers to the pseudonym that Rushdie adopted, which was inspired by the authors Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov. Rushdie’s other novels include The Moor’s Last Sigh, which is narrated by the swiftly aging Moraes Zogoiby; The Ground Beneath Her Feet, which was loosely inspired by the legend of Orpheus; and the young adult books Haroun and the Sea of Stories and Luka and the Fire of Life.\n\nDavid Foster Wallace (1962–2008) was an American author. His massive 1996 novel Infinite Jest depicts a future North America in which years are named after corporate products. The novel is set mainly at the Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House and the Enfield Tennis Academy (where Hal Incandenza is a student). Hal’s father, James, directs “the Entertainment,” a dangerously enthralling film sought by Quebeçois terrorists known as the Wheelchair Assassins. Wallace’s other novels are The Broom of the System and The Pale King, the latter of which was left unfinished at his 2008 suicide. Wallace is also known for his essay collections, including Consider the Lobster and A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again.\n\nZadie Smith (born 1975) is a British novelist. Her 2000 debut novel White Teeth depicts the Bengali Muslim Samad Iqbal and his English friend Archie Jones, who both live in London. Samad’s son Magid becomes an atheist scientist who joins Marcus Chalfen’s project to develop a genetically modified “FutureMouse,” while Magid’s twin brother Millat joins a Muslim fundamentalist group called KEVIN (Keepers of the Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation). Both twins sleep with Archie’s daughter, Irie. Smith’s other novels include NW, which takes place in northwest London; Swing Time, which describes a troubled dancer named Tracey; and the academic novel On Beauty, which is loosely based on E. M. Forster’s novel Howards End."

    "title": "Massacres",
    "content": "The St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre (August 23, 1572) was a series of murders carried out by Catholic mobs and the Swiss Guard against Huguenots, or French Protestants. It occurred a few days after the wedding of Margaret of Valois to the future King Henry IV. Catherine de’ Medici, the mother of then-king Charles IX, allegedly ordered the murders two days after an assassination attempt on Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny. It is likely that the signal to begin the attacks was given by the ringing of matins bells at the church of Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois in Paris. The name of the massacre comes from the day on which it occurred, the night before the feast day of Bartholomew the Apostle.\n\nThe Boston Massacre (March 5, 1770) occurred when British troops stationed in Boston under Captain Thomas Preston opened fire on a crowd of civilians. Five men in the crowd were killed, including former slave Crispus Attucks. The crowd was originally upset that British private Hugh White had struck a wigmaker’s apprentice in the head earlier that day. Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson ordered an inquiry into the event, which led to the arrest of thirteen people. Eight soldiers were defended at their trial by John Adams, and six were acquitted of murder charges. A notable engraving of the Boston Massacre was made by Boston silversmith Paul Revere. British sources often refer to the massacre as “The Incident on King Street.”\n\nThe Peterloo Massacre (August 16, 1819) was a massacre in St. Peter’s Field in Manchester, England during a protest led by Henry Hunt against the Corn Laws. Fourteen people were killed when British cavalry charged the crowd of tens of thousands. In the aftermath of the massacre, the government of Prime Minister Robert Jenkinson, the 2nd Earl of Liverpool, passed the Six Acts to curtail radical gatherings. The name given to the massacre alluded to Napoleon’s final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo four years earlier. The events in Manchester inspired the founding of the newspaper The Manchester Guardian, the predecessor to The Guardian, which is still widely read today. Plotters angry over the Peterloo Massacre and the Six Acts formed the Cato Street Conspiracy in 1820 in the hope of murdering Liverpool and his entire cabinet.\n\nThe Wounded Knee Massacre (December 29, 1890) was the killing of 200 to 300 Lakota Sioux on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation near Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota. The massacre began when, during an observation of the Ghost Dance ritual, a deaf Lakota named Black Coyote refused to surrender his rifle to James Forsyth’s 7th U.S. Cavalry. After the rifle discharged, the cavalrymen opened fire. Miniconjou chief Spotted Elk was among those killed in the massacre, for which twenty soldiers were controversially awarded the Medal of Honor; despite frequent protests, those awards have not been rescinded by Congress. The day after the Wounded Knee Massacre, surviving Lakota confronted the soldiers in the Drexel Mission Fight. The historian Dee Brown titled his 1970 history of Native Americans in the West Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.\n\nBloody Sunday (January 22, 1905) is usually considered the first event of the Revolution of 1905 in Russia. The sequence of events leading up to the massacre began with the Putilov Incident, in which four ironworkers in St. Petersburg were fired because they were members of a labor movement. The resulting strike left St. Petersburg without electricity. On January 22, Father Georgy Gapon of the Russian Orthodox Church led protestors on a march to the Winter Palace to petition Tsar Nicholas II for better working conditions and higher wages. The Imperial Guard fired on the protestors near the Narva Gate. The Revolution of 1905 ultimately led to the establishment of the Russian Duma (parliament) and the adoption of a new constitution. The term “Bloody Sunday” is also used for several other incidents, including several events in Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe St. Valentine’s Day Massacre (February 14, 1929) was the murder of seven members of Bugs Moran’s North Side Gang in Chicago. The murders were carried out by gangsters under the command of Al Capone. It is widely believed that former members of a gang known as Egan’s Rats, including Fred Burke, were the gunmen. The victims were lured to a warehouse in Lincoln Park with the promise of crates of stolen whiskey, which was especially valuable during Prohibition. The only survivor was a dog named Highball. Jack McGurn, one of the gunmen, avoided charges in the massacre thanks to the so-called “Blond Alibi” after taking the chief witness against him across state lines and marrying her. The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre turned public opinion against Capone and led to him being named “Public Enemy No. 1.”\n\nThe Rape of Nanking (beginning December 13, 1937 and lasting six weeks) was a period of mass murder committed in Nanking (today generally spelled “Nanjing”) by the Japanese army early in the Second Sino–Japanese War. At the time, Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China. The Japanese troops were commanded by Prince Yasuhiko Asaka and Iwane Matsui. One famous anecdote from the massacre concerns a contest between two Japanese soldiers to kill 100 Chinese civilians with a sword. Since Japan was not yet at war with the various Western nations, Chinese civilians who were able to make their way into the “Nanking Safety Zone” around the foreign embassies were safe from harm. Episcopalian missionary John Magee extensively photographed the massacre. In 1997, the American-born Chinese author Iris Chang wrote a bestselling account of the massacre titled The Rape of Nanking.\n\nThe My Lai Massacre (March 16, 1968) was a mass murder of at least 300 unarmed Vietnamese civilians in a hamlet codenamed “Pinkville” in Vietnam’s Quang Nai Province by U.S. troops during the Vietnam War. The only man convicted for his role in the massacre was William Calley, who defended himself by saying he was “just following orders” given by Ernest Medina. Helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson Jr. attempted to radio for help and later rescued a four-year-old girl, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Photographs of the massacre were taken by Ronald Haeberle. Seymour Hersh won a Pulitzer Prize for uncovering the events of the My Lai Massacre through extensive interviews with Calley. Hersh later broke the story of the mistreatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib Prison during the Iraq War.\n\nThe Kent State Shootings (May 4, 1970) took place during a nonviolent anti-war demonstration by students at Ohio’s Kent State University. The students were protesting the Nixon administration’s bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. Ohio governor Jim Rhodes called in the National Guard, which fired into the crowd and killed four students: Jeffrey Miller, Allison Krause, William Schroeder, and Sandra Lee Scheur. A photograph taken by John Filo of Mary Ann Vecchio kneeling over the body of Jeffrey Miller won the Pulitzer Prize. Ten days later, two students at the historically black Jackson State University in Mississippi were killed under similar circumstances, but those shootings received far less press attention. The protest song “Ohio” by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young was written shortly after the massacre.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square Protests (June 4, 1989) were a series of student-led pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square during the spring of 1989. One day after the death of former Politburo member Hu Yaobang, students gathered in the public square to demonstrate for greater political freedom. The students camped out in the square for over a month, and similar movements took place throughout China. One famous symbol of the protests was the Goddess of Democracy statue erected in the square. Within the Chinese government, Zhao Ziyang was sympathetic to the students’ demands, but the paramount leader Deng Xiaoping viewed the protests as a challenge to his authority. Martial law was declared on May 20, and the People’s Liberation Army began clearing the square late at night on June 3. The resulting massacre is sometimes known as the June 4 Incident. In an effort to circumvent Chinese censorship, some people also refer to the massacre using terms such as “May 35th” or “VIIV” (the Roman numerals for 6 and 4). A famous photograph, known as “Tank Man,” shows an anonymous protestor standing in front of a row of tanks."

    "title": "Nobel Prize Winners In Physiology Or Medicine",
    "content": "Ronald Ross (won in 1902) was the first British recipient of the Nobel Prize, recognized for his work related to the transmission of malaria. While studying in India, he dissected a mosquito of the species Anopheles (which he termed “dappled-winged” due to its strange posture), and discovered the presence of the malarial parasite (from the genus Plasmodium). He then used birds to demonstrate that the parasite is stored in the salivary gland of mosquitoes and is released when a host is bitten. Ross received the Nobel prize individually in 1902, after fellow bacteriologist Robert Koch voiced his support for him over Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Grassi, who had reported similar findings on the malaria lifecycle.\n\nIvan Pavlov (won in 1904) performed detailed research on the process of digestion, which he published in 1897 in The Work of the Digestive System. By surgically exposing selective sections of a dog’s digestive system, Pavlov was able to study in detail how material moves through the stomach and intestines; he identified the timing of various gastric and pancreatic secretions. While he won the Nobel purely for his contributions to physiology, he’s more well-known for performing the first psychological studies of classical conditioning. After observing the behavior of dogs upon repeatedly bringing them food, Pavlov noticed that the dogs would begin to salivate prior to food even arriving, providing the basis for the concepts of a conditioned response and conditioned stimulus.\n\nRobert Koch (won in 1905) pioneered the field of modern bacteriology, and established his theory of four postulates that must be satisfied in order to determine that a disease is caused by a particular microbe. He used these postulates to discover the bacterial agent that causes tuberculosis, contradicting the popular opinion that the disease was inherited. Koch also determined the causative agents of cholera and anthrax and examined the concept of acquired immunity while on exhibition in German New Guinea.\n\nPaul Ehrlich (won in 1908) performed early work in the field of immunology. He discovered that, after exposing mice to a small dose of ricin and gradually increasing the dose given, the animals developed an immunity to it. In addition to his Nobel-winning work, he also postulated the concept of a “magic bullet,” a compound that could be used to selectively target and eliminate agents of disease. He made his own “magic bullet” in 1909 when he discovered that the compound arsphenamine (now called Salvarsan) could be used as an effective cure for syphilis. In the early phase of his career, Ehrlich developed a close friendship with Robert Koch after presenting him with an improved technique for staining bacteria, which would become the precursor to the technique of Gram staining.\n\nWillem Einthoven (won in 1924) performed groundbreaking work related to electrocardiography. He invented a device called the string galvanometer to measure the electric current of the heart, which until then had been impossible without applying electrodes directly to the heart. This galvanometer would form the basis of the modern ECG (EKG) machine. His method of assigning three leads on human limbs, forming an inverted equilateral triangle centered on the heart, is still used in EKGs today, and is known as Einthoven’s triangle. He also assigned the letters ‘P’, ‘Q’, ‘R’, ‘S’, and ‘T’ to the various deflections seen on an EKG; that notation, which describes the familiar QRS complex pattern, is also still used today.\n\nKarl Landsteiner (won in 1930), known as the “father of transfusions,” made important discoveries in the field of serology in the early 1900s, including the identification of the three major blood groups (A, B, and O). He determined that mixing blood from two individuals with incompatible blood types can lead to a dangerous form of blood clumping called agglutination. In 1937 (after he received the Nobel), he also identified the Rh factor (the “plus” or “minus” in one’s blood type) in the blood of the rhesus monkey, a discovery which further increased the safety of blood transfusions. While studying in Vienna in 1908, Landsteiner isolated the polio virus, providing the basis for Jonas Salk’s vaccine against the disease.\n\nThomas Hunt Morgan (won in 1933) discovered the basic mechanisms of genetic inheritance via his experiments on fruit flies, specifically the species Drosophila melanogaster. By conducting a series of experiments in his renowned “Fly Room” at Columbia University, Morgan and his students tracked mutations, noting how various traits were inherited across successive generations of the flies. His data supported the idea of genetic linkage by noting that the probability of two genes being inherited together correlates inversely with their physical distance on a given chromosome, leading Morgan to postulate the mechanism of crossing over. Because of his work, the unit centimorgan is now used to measure the physical distance between genes.\n\nAlexander Fleming (won in 1945) made the accidental discovery of the antibiotic penicillin after haphazardly stacking Petri dishes in the corner of his notoriously untidy laboratory. He noticed that one culture of the Staphylococcus that he was studying had developed a fungus that destroyed all the nearby colonies of bacteria. After developing the mold in a culture of its own, he discovered that it produced a “mold juice,” later called penicillin, that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. Although Fleming originally believed penicillin to be too slow-acting to have any positive therapeutic effect, it formed the basis for beta-lactam antibiotics, which are still effective in many medical cases today.\n\nJames Watson and Francis Crick won in 1962 for discovering the molecular structure of DNA. They published the well-known double-helix structure based on “Photo 51,” an X-ray diffraction image of DNA produced by Rosalind Franklin. Because Franklin died in 1958 (the Nobel committee does not award prizes posthumously), Francis and Crick instead shared the prize with Maurice Wilkins, a colleague of Franklin who provided them with the diffraction data. The pair also determined, with the help of Chargaff’s rules, that the base pairs of adenine-thymine and cytosine-guanine were structurally similar within the DNA molecule.\n\nBarbara McClintock (won in 1983) described the existence of transposons, also called “jumping genes,” from her observations that certain DNA sequences on the maize she was studying could change position on a chromosome. While studying generations of maize at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, she hypothesized that these “controlling elements” were regulatory in nature, and that their motion around the genome could be the driving factor behind how two identical genetic sequences can exert different functions. McClintock is the only non-shared female recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine."

    "title": "Countries Once Known By Different Names",
    "content": "Bangladesh adopted its current name upon gaining its independence from Pakistan in 1971. In 1947, the partition of British India created the new countries of India and Pakistan, based on the majority religion of various areas. The new Dominion of Pakistan consisted of the areas where Islam was the majority religion, and was split into two separate exclaves: West Pakistan, consisting of what is now Pakistan; and East Pakistan, covering what is now Bangladesh and consisting mostly of ethnic Bengali people. In 1966 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, then head of East Pakistan’s Awami League, launched a major push for greater autonomy. In 1971 Pakistan began a genocide within East Pakistan in response to independence calls; one day later, East Pakistan officially declared independence as “Bangladesh.” In the subsequent Liberation War, the Bengalis were supported by India. Pakistani forces surrendered in December 1971.\n\nBurkina Faso assumed its current name in 1984, having previously been known as the Republic of Upper Volta. France controlled the region under the name French Upper Volta—which referred to its position along the upper course of the Volta River—for much of the 20th century, during which it was one part of French West Africa. Under the 1956 Basic Law, it was made a self-governing colony of France; two years later, it became fully independent under President Maurice Yaméogo, who was overthrown in 1966. A 1983 coup d’état brought military officer Thomas Sankara to power; the year after his ascent, he changed the country’s name to “Burkina Faso,” which roughly translates as “land of the upright” in two native tongues. Sankara was assassinated in 1987.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo was known as Zaire between 1971 and 1997. The 1971 name change came about under the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko, a dictator who effectively seized power during the Congo Crisis of 1960–1965, during which he toppled and later executed Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. The name “Zaire” was derived from the Portuguese word for the Congo River, which itself was derived from a Bantu-language name for the river. Mobutu was ousted and forced into exile following the 1997 First Congo War by the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, a coalition led by Laurent Kabila. Four days after seizing power, Kabila changed the country’s name back to the DRC.\n\neSwatini (also commonly stylized as Eswatini) adopted its current name in 2018, following a proclamation to that effect by King Mswati III, who uses the title Ingwenyama. The tiny absolute monarchy, which is sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique, had previously been known as Swaziland since it became a British protectorate in 1906 following the Second Boer War. The country, which is mostly populated by ethnic Swazis, gained independence from Britain in 1968. The new name of eSwatini, which was adopted in part to mark 50 years of independence, means “the land of Swazis” in the country’s native tongue, which is also known as Swazi.\n\nGhana is a nation of former British holdings on Africa’s west coast, the most prominent of which was the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast was so named by multiple European powers for the rich gold reserves found within the area; in time, the region also became heavily involved in the slave trade. Britain incorporated its Gold Coast Colony in 1821 after seizing the chartered lands of the African Company of Merchants, which had continued to trade in slaves after Britain had outlawed the trade in 1807; Britain subsequently subsumed other nations’s holdings in the region into the British Gold Coast. The modern push for independence began in the late 1940s, and was led by Kwame Nkrumah, who later served as Ghana’s first prime minister and first president. Britain combined its Gold Coast, Northern Territories, Ashanti, and Togoland colonies into a single entity, which became the Dominion of Ghana in 1957. Ghana became a fully independent republic in 1960.\n\nNorth Macedonia officially became known as such in February 2019. For over two decades, the country’s former name, Macedonia had been the subject of a dispute with Greece, which objected to the use of the name “Macedonia” due both to the name’s ties to the ancient Kingdom of Macedon, and the fact that Greece itself contains an administrative region named “Macedonia.” For many years, the country was referred to in the United Nations as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) due to the Greek objection, which also prevented Macedonia from joining the EU and NATO. The countries agreed to resolve the naming dispute in the 2018 Treaty of Prespa.\n\nSri Lanka was referred to by numerous different names in various ancient Greek, Sanskrit, and Arabic texts, including Taprobana and Serendib, and the island became widely known as Ceylon following Portuguese arrival in 1505. The Portuguese gave the island the name Ceilão, which was translated into English as “Ceylon.” The Portuguese, who clashed with the island’s Kingdom of Kandy, were largely driven off the island by a coalition of the Dutch and the island’s Sinhalese people beginning in the 1640s. In 1796, the island passed into British hands after the Dutch were conquered by Napoleon. As part of the divestment of British colonies following World War II, the Dominion of Ceylon became an independent Commonwealth of Nations state in 1948. It adopted the name “Sri Lanka” in 1972.\n\nThe Kingdom of Thailand had its name changed from “Siam” twice within a decade. Portuguese explorers began using the term “Siam” to refer to the region in the 1500s; such usage gained official prominence via its use by rulers from the Chakri dynasty. A rebellion and monarchical crisis in the 1930s led to the 1938 rise of Luang Phibunsongkhram, commonly known as Phibun. In 1939 Phibun officially changed the country’s name to Thailand, or Prathet Thai, having a double meaning of “Land of the Thai” and “Land of the Free”—part of Phibun’s campaign against China. Phibun allied with the Japanese during World War II but was forced out of power in 1944. In 1945, the country’s post-war government changed the nation’s name back to Siam; however, another monarchical crisis sparked by the 1946 assassination of Rama VIII led to Phidun’s return to power in 1948 with U.S. support. In 1949 he once again renamed the country “Thailand.”\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven internal states (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah, Umm Al Quwain, and Ras Al Khaimah) that were previously known as the Trucial States and which united in 1971. The Trucial States were a group of seven sheikhdoms that signed treaties (or truces) with Great Britain beginning in 1820. These states lay along what Britain termed the “Pirate Coast” of the Persian Gulf; the treaties were intended to protect British ships from raids. In the late 19th century, these treaties evolved into an Exclusive Agreement, in which Britain promised the emirates military protection. In 1968, Britain announced it would withdraw military support from the region. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the emir of Abu Dhabi, negotiated an agreement among the Trucial States to join together and became the first president of the United Arab Emirates when it was established in December 1971.\n\nZimbabwe assumed its current name upon its formal independence from Britain in 1980 and was named after the ruined city of Great Zimbabwe within its borders. Zimbabwe grew out of the colony of Rhodesia, named for Cecil Rhodes, which Britain established in southern Africa in the late 19th century. That colony was later split along the Zambezi River into Northern Rhodesia (which later became the country of Zambia) and Southern Rhodesia. Southern Rhodesia’s white government attempted to declare independence from Britain in 1965 (as simply “Rhodesia”) in an effort to suppress the country’s black population, leading to the 15-year-long Rhodesian Bush War. Under the 1979 Lancaster House Agreement, Britain resumed control long enough to oversee elections that were won by the ZANU party, led by Robert Mugabe, who ruled the new country for the next 37 years."

    "title": "Works Of Russian Short Fiction",
    "content": "The Queen of Spades (1834) by Alexander Pushkin. The story begins at a late-night gambling party given by the Russian army officer Naroumov. There, Tomsky discusses his own grandmother, a countess who once lost a fortune paying the card game faro in Paris, and who subsequently sought assistance from the Comte de Saint-Germain (a real historical figure). Saint-Germain taught the countess how to win back her money by playing a sequence of three cards. After hearing this tale, an engineering officer of German descent named Herman schemes to meet the countess by courting her ward Lizaveta, who tells Herman how to secretly enter the house. Herman accosts the countess, who refuses to reveal the names of the cards. When Herman draws a pistol, the countess dies of fright. At the countess’s funeral, her corpse appears to wink at Herman. That night, Herman is visited by the countess’s ghost, who tells him that the cards are the three, seven, and ace. Herman goes to the gambling salon of Chekalinsky, where he wins a massive sum of money by betting on the three. The following night, Herman wins again by betting on the seven. On the third night he intends to bet everything on the ace, but the card that he actually plays is the queen of spades. When Herman looks at the card, it seems to wink at him as the countess had done. Herman goes insane and is put in an asylum, where he spends his days muttering “three seven ace! Three seven queen!”\n\nNevsky Prospekt (1835) by Nikolai Gogol. Nevsky Prospekt is a major thoroughfare in Saint Petersburg. After describing the various types of people who walk down the street at different times of day, the story focuses on two men, who each pursue a beautiful woman. The first is Piskaryov, a painter who sees a dark-haired woman, follows her to the brothel where she works, and falls obsessively in love with her, eventually turning to opium to calm himself. He returns and proposes to the woman, but she mocks his advances, after which Piskaryov cuts his own throat. The second man, Lieutenant Pirogov, follows a blond woman. She turns out to be the wife of a German tinsmith, who beats Pirogov. The lieutenant plans to avenge himself, but abandons the idea after eating pastries and going dancing.\n\nThe Nose (1836) by Nikolai Gogol. On the morning of March 25, the barber Yakovlevich cuts open a loaf of bread, and discovers a nose inside it. The nose belongs to Major Kovalyov, who wakes up the same day to find a smooth patch of skin where his nose used to be. Upon encountering his missing nose, which is traveling in a carriage and wearing the uniform of a state councillor, Kovalyov chases it to a shopping center called the Gostiny Dvor. There, Kovalyov wonders how to approach the nose, since its uniform indicates that it has a higher status than him. Summoning his courage, Kovalyov tries to convince the nose to return to his face, but the nose claims not to recognize him. Kovalyov goes to a newspaper, intending to offer a reward for the nose’s return, but the clerk refuses his absurd-sounding request. Kovalyov then speaks with the police, who later catch the nose attempting to flee to Riga. However, the doctor that Kovalyov consults is unable to re-attach the nose, even with an operation. Kovalyov writes a letter to Madame Alexandra Podtochina Grigorievna, accusing her of cursing him so that he will marry her daughter, but receives an uncomprehending reply. Finally, on April 7, Kovalyov wakes up with his nose reattached, and resumes his normal life.\n\nThe Overcoat (1842) by Nikolai Gogol. Remarking on the story’s importance to Russian literature, Fyodor Dostoyevsky quipped “we all come out of Gogol’s overcoat.” The story’s protagonist is Akaky Akakievich, a poor government clerk whose only joy in life is copying documents. His coworkers often make fun of his worn-out overcoat, so he visits his tailor Petrovich, who says that the coat must be replaced. Akaky scrimps to save up the necessary 80 roubles, and finally acquires the coat after receiving an unexpectedly large bonus. As he walks home from a party that was given in part to honor the new garment, Akaky is accosted by two ruffians who steal his overcoat. Akaky tries to seek justice from the municipal superintendent and from an “important personage,” but both refuse to help him. Soon afterwards, Akaky contracts a fever and dies. His ghost is said to haunt the streets of Saint Petersburg, searching for the stolen cloak. Eventually, the “important personage” is accosted by a figure whom he believes to be Akaky’s ghost, and is forced to surrender his own coat. However, the story’s final words hint that the supposed “ghost” was actually an ordinary robber.\n\nThe Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886) by Leo Tolstoy. The story begins in a courtroom, as the death of the middle-aged magistrate Ivan Ilyich prompts other members of the legal profession to think about how the new vacancy will affect their status. The story then describes Ivan’s unhappy marriage to Praskovya Fedorovna, and his move to Saint Petersburg. As he decorates his new house, Ivan has an accident while demonstrating how he wishes the curtains to be hung. The accident slowly causes Ivan to suffer increasing pain, during which he becomes dependant on the peasant servant Gerasim, and contemplates how meaningless his existence has been. At the end of his life, Ivan screams continuously for three days. Finally, Ivan sees light all around him at the same time that his son Vasya kisses his hand, and realizes that all he can do to end his family’s suffering is to die. Ivan thus dies happily.\n\nHow Much Land Does a Man Need? (1886) by Leo Tolstoy. At the start of the story, a peasant named Pahom listens to his wife and sister-in-law debate whether it is better to live in the town or the country. Pahom thinks “if I had plenty of land, I wouldn’t fear the Devil himself!”—which the Devil hears from behind the stove. Shortly thereafter, Pahom purchases land from a village woman. He becomes exceedingly jealous and protective of his property, causing him to quarrel with his neighbors and the local judges. Learning of rich land elsewhere, Pahom moves his family, but still is not satisfied. Desirous of acquiring even more land, Pahom visits the nomadic Bashkirs. Their chief, who is possibly the Devil in disguise, says that one thousand roubles will buy as much land as Pahom can walk around in a single day. However, if Pahom does not return to his starting point by sunset, both the money and the land are forfeit. In his greed, Pahom ventures too far. He sprints back while the chief laughs, just as the Devil did in one of Pahom’s dreams. Pahom returns to the starting point just in time, but immediately drops dead from exhaustion. A servant buries Pahom in a grave that is six feet long, thus answering the story’s title question: a man only needs six feet of land.\n\nThe Kreutzer Sonata (1889) by Leo Tolstoy. Both Russia and the U.S. censored this novella, which describes the fatal results of an affair. As passengers on a train discuss marriage and love, a “nervous man” named Basile Posdnicheff breaks into the conversation, and insists that romantic love cannot endure for a lifetime. Posdnicheff recalls the dissipations of his bachelor days before explaining how he courted his wife, whom he accuses of trapping him into marriage with her physical charms. According to Posdnicheff, the idleness of the well-fed upper classes leads to an unhealthy emphasis on romance, giving women power over men. He advocates the ideal of celibacy even in marriage, astonishing the other train passengers. Posdnicheff describes quarrels with his wife, complaining that she was overly concerned with the health of their children, and that she eventually used contraception. As the marriage grows intolerable, Posdnifcheff’s wife spends more time playing the piano, and is introduced by Posdnicheff to Troukhatchevsky, who studied the violin in Paris. Although Posdnicheff is initially suspicious of Troukhatchevsky, he is comforted by his wife’s disavowal of interest in the musician, and by the elevated emotions he feels while listening to his wife and Troukhatchevsky play Beethoven’s Kreutzer Sonata. However, Posdnicheff’s jealousy returns during a work trip, when he receives a letter from his wife mentioning Troukhatchevsky. He takes a long journey back to his house, where he finds Troukhatchevsky’s overcoat. Posdnicheff removes his shoes to walk more quietly, takes a dagger from the wall, and surprises the pair in the dining room. Because he does not wish to run after Troukhatchevsky without shoes, Posdnicheff turns on his wife, and fatally stabs her. Although jailed while awaiting trial, Posdnicheff is ultimately acquitted because of his wife’s suspected infidelity.\n\nThe Bet (1889) by Anton Chekhov. An old banker recalls a bet that he made 15 years ago at a party, in response to an argument about whether capital punishment is more or less cruel than life in prison. A lawyer suggests that life in prison is superior, because it would be better to have some existence than none at all. The rash banker bets two million roubles that the lawyer would not last five years in solitary confinement; the lawyer insists he could withstand 15 years, and the bet is on. The lawyer is often unhappy during the early years of his confinement in a lodge on the banker’s estate. However, the lawyer betters himself by refusing wine and tobacco, and gradually studies languages, history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and science. Meanwhile, the banker grows steadily poorer, and realizes that paying off the bet will leave him bankrupt. On the last day of the bet, the banker resolves to kill the lawyer, and sneaks into the lodge while the lawyer is sleeping. There, the banker finds a letter in which the lawyer explains that years of study have taught him to scorn earthly knowledge and riches, and to care only about the salvation of his soul. The lawyer thus plans to leave the lodge five hours before 12 o’clock on November 14, 1885, when he would have won the bet. The banker departs without doing the lawyer harm and the lawyer carries out his plan, allowing the banker to avoid ruin. The banker then hides the lawyer’s note in a safe, to avoid “unnecessary talk.”\n\nWard No. 6 (1892) by Anton Chekhov. The story is set in a run-down asylum, whose five inmates include the university-educated Ivan Gromov and the imbecilic Moiseika. Moiseika is the only inmate allowed to go into town, where he begs for items that are all confiscated by Nikita, the asylum’s porter. The hospital is run by the medical assistant Sergei Sergeyitch and by the doctor Andrei Yefimitch Ragin, whose supervision gradually becomes lax. Andrei discusses philosophical issues with the postmaster Mikhail Averyanich, and later begins to engage in such conversations with Ivan. Dr. Yevgeny Hobotov, whom a local council appoints to work at the hospital, grows concerned at Andrei’s long conversations with an inmate. Fearing that Andrei is not well, Mikhail proposes that they take a trip to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Warsaw, but the journey goes poorly, and Andrei spends most of his money paying off Mikhail’s gambling debts. Upon returning, Andrei finds out that he has been fired and replaced by Dr. Hobotov. Andrei withdraws into himself, and eventually shouts at Mikhail and Dr. Hobotov to leave him alone. Dr. Hobotov tricks Andrei into entering Ward No. 6, where mental patients are confined. When Andrei protests his incarceration, Nikita beats him. Andrei soon dies of a stroke; Mikhail and Andrei’s servant Daryushka are the only people at the funeral.\n\nThe Lady with a Dog (1899) by Anton Chekhov. The married banker Dmitri Gurov has been on vacation by himself in Yalta for two weeks when he hears of a “new face” attracting attention, a lady with a dog. Dmitri meets the woman, Anna Sergeyevna von Diderits. She is vacationing without her spouse, as her marriage is unhappy—just like Dmitri’s. The two sleep together. After returning to Moscow, Dmitri cannot forget the memory of Anna, and realizes he has fallen in love. He pretends to be going to Saint Petersburg for business, but instead travels to Anna’s hometown. There, he finds her at the debut of a play titled The Geisha. Dmitri confronts Anna at the performance, and she confesses that she too has fallen in love. Anna begins making excuses to visit Moscow every few months to see Dmitri. The two fall deeper in love, but do not know how to leave their marriages. The story ends on an unresolved note, stating “to both of them it was clear that the end was still very far off, and that their hardest and most difficult period was only just beginning.”"

    "title": "Silent Films",
    "content": "The Corbett–Fitzsimmons Fight (1897) is a film of the 1897 match in which boxer Bob Fitzsimmons knocked out Jim Corbett in the fourteenth round, becoming the World Heavyweight Champion. The film, footage for which was shot by three separate cameras, contained all of the match’s rounds; thus, its run time of over approximately 90 minutes made it the first feature-length film ever created. The film was overseen by Enoch Rector, an employee of the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company who created the huge Veriscope camera, and utilized the innovation of the Latham loop, which stabilized a strip of film and allowed films to be much longer than previously possible. Much of the film is now considered lost.\n\nA Trip to the Moon (Le Voyage dans la Lune) (1902) was written and directed by pioneering French filmmaker Georges Méliès, who also plays the film’s protagonist, Professor Barbenfouillis. The professor leads a group of explorers who travel to the moon by entering a bullet-shaped capsule that is fired out of a cannon; this leads to the film’s most iconic shot, as the Man in the Moon is struck in the eye by the capsule. On the moon, they are observed by Greco-Roman gods, find a cave filled with giant mushrooms, and encounter a strange race of lunar creatures (Selenites) who disappear in a puff of smoke when struck. The explorers are captured by the Selenites; after killing the Selenite ruler, they flee back to their capsule and return to Earth—with a Selenite clinging along for the ride. The film, which was based on the works of Jules Verne, runs between approximately 10 and 20 minutes, depending on the speed the film is played.\n\nThe Great Train Robbery (1903) was a Western film directed by Edwin S. Porter and distributed by Thomas Edison’s manufacturing company. Outlaws force a telegraph operator to order a train to stop; the outlaws then board the stopped train, steal the mail on board, rob the passengers, and escape on the decoupled locomotive. Meanwhile, the telegraph operator is discovered and freed, and a posse is organized to chase the robbers. In a climactic battle, the posse kills all of the outlaws. The film, 12–13 minutes long, was a huge commercial success, and is often claimed to be the first narrative film—which is completely untrue. In an iconic scene included with the film, Justus Barnes (who played the outlaw leader) fires his pistol directly into the camera.\n\nThe Birth of a Nation (1915), directed by D. W. Griffith, is simultaneously lauded as a landmark work in the history of filmmaking and reviled for its horrifying racism. The film, which was based on and originally titled for Thomas Dixon’s novel The Clansman, is a three-hour epic that follows the Stoneman family of D.C. and the Cameron family of South Carolina through the eras of the Civil War and Reconstruction. The families are united by the love of Elsie Stoneman (played by Lillian Gish) and Ben Cameron (played by Henry Walthall). In the film, Ben Cameron founds the Ku Klux Klan to rescue white southerners from newly freed and empowered African-Americans; the film is commonly cited as the major factor behind the rebirth of the real-life KKK shortly after its release. At its release, the film was protested by the NAACP and many other groups due to its overt racist content.\n\nIntolerance (1916), also directed by D. W. Griffith, was partly inspired by what Griffith considered to be the “intolerant” reactions of those who protested against The Birth of a Nation. Griffith’s film—which, at a run time of over 200 minutes, was even longer than Birth—weaves together four tales in which intolerance causes a great tragedy: the fall of Babylon, the crucifixion of Christ, the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, and the contemporary story of a fictional mill worker strike. The film repeatedly cuts between the four stories, using the image of a woman (Lillian Gish) rocking a cradle to transition between them. The film was notable for its massive budget, and for its massive sets—for the depiction of Belshazzar’s Feast in the “Babylon” section of the film, Griffith built a 300-foot-tall set complete with monumental sculptures.\n\nThe Thief of Baghdad (1924) is an adventure film loosely based on the Arabian Nights directed by Raoul Walsh, starring Douglas Fairbanks (who had previously starred in 1922’s Robin Hood) as a thief named Ahmed. After sneaking into the caliph’s palace, Ahmed falls in love with the princess; he subsequently disguises himself to compete with three other princes for her hand in marriage. Although he is exposed as a common thief, he eventually manages to win over the caliph by summoning a magical army to defeat the forces of the treacherous Mongol prince. This film—with its at-the-time staggering budget of over 1 million dollars—was notable for its lavish special effects, including a flying horse and a flying carpet.\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera (1925) is an adaptation of the Gaston Leroux novel of the same name. The film starred legendary horror actor Lon Chaney as Erik, a deformed polymath and composer who haunts the Paris Opera House and torments managers and stars. Erik falls in love with Christine Daaé, a young singer whom he tutors in secret. Christine is also loved by the vicomte Raoul. The Phantom captures and nearly kills Raoul, but relents when Christine pleads for Raoul’s life; the Phantom is eventually killed by a mob as Raoul and Christine escape together. The film is notable for Chaney’s horrifying makeup as the Phantom, which Chaney devised himself; the iconic scene in which Christine removes the Phantom’s mask and first reveals his skull-like face has remained shocking to even 21st-century audiences.\n\nMetropolis (1927), directed by German filmmaker Fritz Lang, was a landmark epic film in the science fiction genre. Freder (played by Gustav Fröhlich) is the son of Joh Fredersen, the “master” of a city whose upper-class elite live lives powered by machines run by impoverished workers. After falling in love with Maria, a member of the worker class, Freder joins with the workers in their struggle to improve their lives, wishing to serve as a “mediator” between the upper and lower classes. An inventor named Rotwang creates a robot double of Maria to disrupt the workers’ attempts at organizing. At its release, Metropolis was lambasted for its length of 2.5 hours. The film is renowned for its pioneering and influential robot costuming, as well as for cinematographer Eugen Schüfftan’s technique for using mirrors to make human actors appear to be part of miniature sets.\n\nUn Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog) (1929) is a collaborative work between artist Salvador Dalí and filmmaker Luis Buñuel. It is an iconic work in the artistic style of surrealism, as it intentionally has no discernable plot; its title cards also indicate unusual time jumps, such as “eight years later,” “sixteen years earlier,” “about 3 in the morning.” The film opens with one of the most iconic scenes in cinema history: a short of a cloud crossing in front of the moon is intercut with a shot of a man slicing a woman’s eye open with a razor (actually the eye of a dead calf). The film’s other notable shots include ants emerging from a man’s hand and two people buried in sand. Dalí himself appears in the film as a priest. Dalí and Buñuel collaborated on a followup to the film, L’Age d’Or (The Age of Gold), released the following year.\n\nCity Lights (1931) was written by, was directed by, and starred Charlie Chaplin, in his recurring character of the “Little Tramp.” While wandering the street, the Tramp meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill), with whom he falls in love; due to a series of coincidences, the flower girl comes to believe the Tramp is wealthy. Through his encounters with a millionaire—who repeatedly befriends the Tramp while drunk, but forgets having done so once sober—the Tramp acquires enough money to pay for a medical procedure that will restore the girl’s sight. Her vision restored, the flower girl recognizes the poor Tramp as her benefactor via the feel of his hand. City Lights is unusual in that it was a silent feature film made after The Jazz Singer (1927) had inaugurated the era of “talkies”; while City Lights does not feature any spoken dialogue, it does have a synchronized soundtrack."

    "title": "Active Volcanoes",
    "content": "Mount Erebus, a stratovolcano, is the second-highest volcano in Antarctica (but tallest active one) and the southernmost active volcano in the world. Mount Erebus sits on Ross Island. It took its name from the primordial personification of darkness in Greek mythology. The northeast slope of Mount Erebus is known as “Fang Ridge,” and the volcano’s underground magma produces unique pieces of feldspar known as “Erebus crystals.” In 1979 an Air New Zealand jet crashed into the side of Mount Erebus, killing 257 people.\n\nMount Etna is a stratovolcano in eastern Sicily that plays a significant role in ancient Greek myths. Zeus trapped the monster Typhon under Mount Etna, and the volcano is also the site of Hephaestus’s forges. Mount Etna overlooks the Sicilian town of Catania. It most recently erupted in 2015. Earlier eruptions occurred in 1928 (destroying the village of Mascali) and in 1669, after which the volcano was thought to have gone dormant. There is a large depression on the side of Mount Etna known as Valle del Bove, or “Valley of the Ox.”\n\nMount Fuji, a stratovolcano on the island of Honshu, is Japan’s tallest mountain. Mount Fuji is one of the “Three Holy Mountains” of Japan, along with Mount Haku and Mount Tate. Mount Fuji last erupted in December 1707 in the lava-less Hoei Eruption. Because of its beautiful shape, Mount Fuji is a frequent muse for artists, including the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai, whose woodblock series Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji includes The Great Wave off Kanagawa. Aokigahara, popularly known as the “Suicide Forest,” is on the volcano’s northwestern slope.\n\nKilauea is a shield volcano that is the most active of the five volcanoes on the Big Island of Hawaii. The name “Kilauea” means “spewing” or “spreading” in the Hawaiian language. In Hawaiian mythology, the volcano is the home of the fire goddess Pele. The three primary craters of Kilauea are Halemaʻumaʻu Crater, Puʻu Crater, and Puʻu ʻOʻo Crater. In addition, part of the volcano is covered by the Kaʻu Desert, a plain of dried lava and volcanic ash. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is on the rim of Kilauea’s caldera.\n\nKrakatoa is a stratovolcanic island in the Sunda Strait between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. Prior to its massive 1883 eruption, there were three separate volcanic peaks: Perboewatan (completely destroyed by the eruption), Rakata (extant), and Danan (almost completely destroyed). The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa killed more than 35,000 people and is believed to have produced the loudest sound ever. Krakatoa is one of the largest volcanoes in the Pacific Ring of Fire. The continued activity of Krakatoa formed a new island, Anak Krakatau (or “Child of Krakatoa”) in 1927.\n\nMauna Loa is a shield volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii that is the most massive above-sea volcano on Earth. It should not be confused with Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano that is the tallest mountain in Hawaii. Both Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa are taller than Mount Everest when measuring from base-to-summit rather than from sea level. Along with Kilauea, Mauna Loa forms the Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park, which was established in 1916 by Woodrow Wilson. When Mauna Loa erupted in 1942, four months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government gagged the press from reporting on the eruption.\n\nMount Pinatubo is a stratovolcano in the Zambales Mountains on the western coast of the island of Luzon in the Philippines. In the aftermath of its 1991 eruption, the global temperature briefly decreased by almost a full degree Fahrenheit due to the ejection of aerosols and sulfuric acid. That eruption was ten times more powerful than the 1980 eruption of Mount Saint Helens; it killed at least 800 people and forced the evacuation of some 20,000 people. In its aftermath, monsoon rains created Lake Pinatubo in the resulting crater. In 2010, the indigenous Aeta people were formally granted domain over the volcano.\n\nMount Rainier is a stratovolcano that is the highest peak in the Cascades and in the state of Washington. It is located about 50 miles southeast of Seattle. The three principal peaks of Mount Rainier are Columbia Crest (the tallest), Point Success, and Liberty Cap; the Little Tahoma Peak is a remnant of an older, much larger Mount Rainier that has since eroded away. Mount Rainier has not erupted since the mid-to-late nineteenth century. The Nisqually Glacier, on Mount Rainier’s southwestern slope, is used to track climate change. The Emmons Glacier on Mount Rainier is the largest glacier by area in the contiguous U.S., while the Carbon Glacier is the largest by volume. The entirety of Mount Rainier is in Mount Rainier National Park, the fifth national park established in the U.S.\n\nMount Saint Helens is another stratovolcano in the Cascades of Washington state. It is about 100 miles south of Seattle and about 50 miles north of Portland. It last erupted in May 1980, killing 57 people in the most devastating volcanic eruption in U.S. history. Perhaps the most famous casualty of that eruption was an innkeeper named Harry Truman (no relation to the president of the same name) who refused to evacuate from the mountain. Because of an avalanche of volcanic debris during that eruption, Mount Saint Helens lost about 1300 feet in height; lahars (mudflows of pyroclastic material) reached all the way to the Columbia River. The volcano is surrounded by Gifford Pinchot National Forest.\n\nMount Vesuvius is a stratovolcano on the Gulf of Naples in Campania in south-central Italy. Mount Vesuvius, which last erupted in 1944, is the only active volcano on mainland Europe. The most notable eruption of Mount Vesuvius was in AD 79 when it buried the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae. The only surviving eyewitness accounts of that eruption are a pair of letters written by Pliny the Younger to Tacitus. The 1908 Summer Olympics were relocated from Rome to London after a surprise eruption of Mount Vesuvius."

    "title": "Dutch Paintings",
    "content": "The Night Watch (1642) by Rembrandt van Rijn. The centerpiece of the collection of the Netherlands’ Rijksmuseum, this painting depicts a schutterij, a type of civic guard common in Dutch Golden Age cities. The militia company is led by Frans Banning Cocq, who is depicted in black with a red sash, and his lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch, dressed in yellow. Other standout figures in the painting include a small woman in a yellow dress who carries a dead chicken, a symbol of the militia company. The painting is enormous, measuring nearly 12 feet high and 14 feet wide; it was even wider before it was cut down in the 18th century to fit in the Amsterdam Town Hall.\n\nThe Anatomy Lesson of Doctor Nicolaes Tulp (1632) by Rembrandt van Rijn. Commonly known as just The Anatomy Lesson. The painting depicts the yearly public dissection held by the Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons, several of whose members paid commissions in order to be included in the portrait. Tulp’s successor as the city anatomist, Jan Deijman, was also depicted by Rembrandt giving an anatomy lesson. The man being dissected is a criminal, Aris Kindt, who was hanged for armed robbery. A famous anatomy treatise by Andreas Vesalius can be seen opened at the painting’s bottom right corner.\n\nBelshazzar’s Feast (1635) by Rembrandt van Rijn. The painting shows a scene from the Book of Daniel in which the king of Babylon, Belshazzar, uses the loot his father Nebuchadnezzar stole from the Temple in Jerusalem in order to throw a feast. During the feast, God’s hand appears and writes a prophecy on the wall predicting Belshazzar’s downfall—a vision that frightens the onlookers in the painting as well, one of whom is spilling a goblet in horror. The Hebrew letters in the painting are based on a font created by the Dutch rabbi Menasseh ben Israel, but are written top to bottom instead of right to left.\n\nThe Music Lesson (c. 1660s) by Jan Vermeer. The painting is alternatively titled Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman, an exact description of its subject matter. On the floor near the keyboard instrument lies a viol, a large bowed string instrument also common during the Baroque era. In the documentary Tim’s Vermeer, Tim Jenison attempted to test the theory that Vermeer painted with the help of optical devices such as a camera obscura to achieve accurate perspective, a theory also advanced by contemporary British artist David Hockney and physicist Charles Falco.\n\nThe Milkmaid (c. 1658) by Jan Vermeer. The title is misleading, as it actually shows a house or kitchen maid, rather than a milkmaid working with cows. The painting’s striking features include the tiny stream of milk being poured into a bowl and the intricate folds of the maid’s blue dress. The table, which is covered with a blue cloth, is a Dutch gateleg, which has an octagonal shape when unfolded, explaining its odd angles. A foot warmer sits behind the central female figure; in Vermeer’s time, the object would indicate that the woman is single.\n\nThe Art of Painting (c. 1660s) by Jan Vermeer. This painting, alternatively known as The Allegory of Painting, may be either a self-portrait or a depiction of the artist’s craft; the face of the artist dressed in black, who faces away from the viewer, cannot be seen. The blue-clad model in the painting stands near a window and may be portraying Clio, the Muse of History; she holds a trumpet and cradles a large yellow book presumed to be Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War. Behind the large candelabra in the painting, a map of the Low Countries hangs on the studio’s back wall.\n\nThe Laughing Cavalier (1624) by Frans Hals. This portrait, whose unknown subject is not actually laughing, acquired its common title after being moved to the Bethnal Green Museum in Britain in the 1870s; before that, it was simply known as Portrait of a Man. The painting’s subject is dressed in fine black clothing appropriate to Calvinist sensibilities of the Dutch Republic, wears a giant white collar, has a prominent upturned moustache, and is 26 years old according to an inscription at the upper right hand corner.\n\nLandscape with the Fall of Icarus (c. 1560s) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The fall of Icarus is not the central image in this painting; the mythological youth’s legs stick out of the water, barely noticed, near a large ship and a fisherman at the bottom right. Most of the painting depicts everyday scenes in the Netherlandish countryside, such as a farmer driving a horse while plowing his field and a shepherd staring up at the sky while attending to his sheep. In the distance can be seen a city with a harbor, which the ships in the painting appear to be sailing towards. The painting is famously depicted in W. H. Auden’s poem “Musée des Beaux Arts,” whose title derives from the Brussels museum where the painting is held.\n\nHunters in the Snow (1565) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This painting is the most famous of the five surviving paintings from Bruegel’s Months of the Year cycle. Several black birds are perched in the barren, snowy trees above the hunters in this painting, who are returning home with their dogs, having had very little success in their hunt. The town’s rivers and pond have frozen over, preventing its water wheel from working, but the denizens have taken advantage of this and are ice-skating. The painting features in several films by famous directors, such as Andrei Tarkovsky’s Solaris and Mirror.\n\nThe Proposition (1631) by Judith Leyster. Leyster was a female artist whose entire body of work was once attributed to Frans Hals. The painting’s two subjects are a woman sewing by candlelight and a man touching her right shoulder and offering her coins. Unlike in Vermeer’s The Milkmaid, the foot warmer in this painting is partway under the woman’s skirt, indicating that she is married, but potentially interested in a suitor. Despite this, the woman appears to be ignoring the man’s romantic advances."

    "title": "Founders Of Religious Traditions",
    "content": "Abraham was a patriarch common to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which are collectively known as the Abrahamic religions. Unlike the other people in this article, Abraham is not regarded as a historical figure in secular studies. He is the subject of the Biblical narrative of the covenant of the pieces, in which God promises that his descendants would inherit the Promised Land of Canaan/Israel; this tradition is the basis for the view that the Jewish people are God’s chosen people. In Islam, Abraham (Ibrahim) is considered a major link in the chain of prophets stretching from Adam to Muhammad. In Christianity, he is considered an exemplar of faith because of his willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac at God’s command.\n\nZoroaster or Zarathustra (time unknown, perhaps second millennium BC) was an ancient Persian prophet who founded the dualistic religion Zoroastrianism around the 10th century BC. He is said to have had a revelation in which he saw a being who taught him about two primal spirits: a benevolent creator named Ahura Mazda and a malevolent spirit named Angra Mainyu or Ahriman. Zoroaster also learned about the concepts of asha and druj, roughly equivalent to “truth” and “falsehood,” and thereafter chose to dedicate his life to promoting asha.\n\nMahavira (fifth or sixth century BC) was the founder of modern Jainism. Jains regard him as the twenty-fourth tirthankara, or spiritual teacher, who revived and synthesized ancient traditions. His mother, Trishala, is said to have had either fourteen or sixteen auspicious dreams before his birth. In his forties, Mahavira is said to have achieved Kevala Jnana, or infinite knowledge, while meditating under a salah tree. He subsequently taught a number of principles, including ahimsa, the prohibition of violence against living beings of any kind.\n\nSiddhartha Gautama (fifth or sixth century BC), also known as the Buddha, was the founder of Buddhism. His mother Maya is said to have dreamt that a six-tusked elephant entered her right side, ten months before she gave birth to Siddhartha in Lumbini. The future Buddha grew up in a palace, but he adopted an ascetic lifestyle after he encountered a sick man, a corpse, and an ascetic outside his father’s court. Like Mahavira, the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment while meditating under a tree—in this case, the Bodhi tree. He learned the Four Noble Truths, which hold that humans are kept in samsara, the endless cycle of death and rebirth, by our attachment to impermanent things, and that the cycle can be ended by attaining nirvana.\n\nConfucius (551–479 BC) was a Chinese philosopher whose teachings are the basis for Confucianism, a tradition sometimes described as a philosophy and sometimes as a religion. Confucius’s disciples organized his teachings into the Analects. He emphasized such ideas as li (decorum and proper behavior) and ren (benevolence or humaneness). He taught that disorder often arose from the failure to call things by their proper names, so he advocated the rectification of names. His followers developed his teachings in different directions; the most famous of them, Mencius, emphasized the innate goodness of human beings.\n\nMuhammad (c. AD 570–632) was a prophet who founded Islam. Born in Mecca in the Year of the Elephant, he is said to have been visited by the angel Jibril (or Gabriel) in the cave of Hira, where Jibril revealed the Qur’an to him. During the Night Journey, Muhammad is said to have traveled on the horse Buraq to “the farthest mosque” and to have visited heaven. Because of plots against him in Mecca, Muhammad traveled from Mecca to Medina along with his followers and established the Islamic community there. When war broke out between his followers and the people of Mecca, he served as a military commander, winning several engagements, including the Battle of Badr. His death led to disputes among his followers as to whether Abu Bakr or Ali was his true successor.\n\nGuru Nanak (1469–1539) was the founder of Sikhism and the first of the ten gurus of Sikhism. Collections of his hymns formed the original basis for the Guru Granth Sahib, the primary scripture of Sikhism, which is regarded as the eleventh guru. Many miracle stories about Guru Nanak’s life are told in his biographies, which are collectively known as Janamsakhis. According to one such story, when he died, his body disappeared and was replaced with flowers, which were divided among Hindus and Muslims. According to another such story, he slept with his feet facing the Kaaba; when Muslims tried to move them away, the Kaaba moved so that his feet were still facing it.\n\nJoseph Smith (1805–1844) was the founder of Mormonism (many of whose followers now call themselves Latter-Day Saints). He is said to have had a vision in which the angel Moroni directed him to a set of golden plates, from which he claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon, the founding scripture of Mormonism. Based on Ezekiel’s vision of a New Jerusalem, he hoped to establish a latter-day Zion in America. Smith initially planned to establish his Zion in Independence, Missouri, but his followers were driven out of the area and moved to Nauvoo, Illinois. When the Nauvoo Expositor criticized him for his teachings on polygamy and other matters, he had the press destroyed and was charged with inciting a riot; while awaiting trial, he was killed by a mob.\n\nBahá’u’lláh (1817–1892) was the founder of the Bahá’í faith. He was a follower of the Báb, the founder of a predecessor of Bahá’í called Bábism. At the Garden of Ridvan, Bahá’u’lláh declared himself to be the fulfillment of the Báb’s prophecy about “he whom God shall make manifest.” He was exiled to the outer reaches of the Ottoman Empire for fear that his teachings would cause unrest. He was later imprisoned in Acre (in what is now Israel), where he spent much of his time writing texts such as the Kitab-i-Aqdas (literally, “the book of laws”). Bahá’u’lláh’s other books include The Book of Certitude and Epistle to the Son of the Wolf.\n\nMary Baker Eddy (1821–1910) was the founder of Christian Science. Sickly for much of her life, she sought treatment from many different healers, including a mesmerist and magnetic healer named Phineas Quimby. This experience inspired Eddy to write a book titled Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, in which she equated God with the mind and argued that sickness is spiritual, not material. Eddy believed that mental techniques could be used not only for healing, but also to harm people, which she termed “malicious animal magnetism.” She founded the Christian Science Monitor and laid out guidelines for her church in the Manual of the Mother Church, which established Christian Science reading rooms."

    "title": "Chemistry Lab Techniques",
    "content": "Flame Tests detect the presence of elements by dipping a wooden splint or nichrome wire in a sample of the element or its salt, then placing the sample over a Bunsen burner. The unique emission spectrum of the element present then causes the flame to briefly change color. The D lines of sodium produce one of the strongest flame test colors: a bright yellow. Because of this, sodium can contaminate samples, so flames are usually viewed through a cobalt blue glass to filter out the yellow. Other notable flame test colors include red, produced by lithium, calcium and strontium; lilac, produced by potassium; green, produced by barium; and blue, produced by copper, selenium, arsenic, and indium.\n\nTitrations calculate the concentration of a solution by adding in small volumes of a reactant of known concentration until a chemical change, like a pH indicator changing color, occurs. Acid-base titrations are usually performed in a thin glass tube called a buret and use pH indicators like phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to calculate the pH at any point during a titration. The equivalence point is the point at which equal amounts of acid and base have been mixed and there is a sharp inflection point in the pH curve. Redox titrations use an oxidation-reduction reaction instead of an acid-base reaction. In complexometric titrations, the analyte forms a coordination complex with the titrant. Karl Fischer titrations use electrolysis to determine the amount of water in a substance.\n\nDistillation separates a mixture of liquids based on their boiling point by heating, causing the more volatile component to vaporize and condense in a different container while the other components remain in the original vessel. In the laboratory, the vapors are usually cooled with a water-based Liebig condenser or Vigreux condenser, and the product is collected in a round-bottomed receiving flask. In industry, multiple rounds of distillation are performed in a single “column” packed with trays, each of which can be modeled as a “theoretical plate.” Oil refining relies on fractional distillation, in which different products are pulled out of the mixture at various trays along the column. Azeotropes are mixtures that cannot be separated because at the specified pressure and composition, both components boil at the same temperature.\n\nCalorimetry calculates the heat or enthalpy change of a chemical or physical process by using specialized vessels to measure a change in temperature. A very simple calorimeter can be made by placing a thermometer in an insulating polystyrene coffee cup and sealing it with a lid, causing the reaction inside to occur at constant pressure. Bomb calorimeters are very sturdy containers used to conduct combustion reactions at constant volume. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a variant which can be used to determine the binding affinites and stoichiometry of proteins and enzymatic reactions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is another variant that measures how a compound’s heat capacity changes with temperature; it is commonly used to determine properties of polymers such as their melting point or glass transition temperature.\n\nChromatography separates a complex mixture into its individual components, commonly illustrated by the separation of pen ink into many colors. Chromatography involves two components: a mobile phase, which moves, and a stationary phase, which interacts differently with different components of the mobile phase to produce a separation. For example, in thin-layer chromatography, a mixture is spotted on one end of a plate of silica gel (the stationary phase), then a solvent (the mobile phase) carries the components across the plate and separates them based on their polarity—polar substances will strongly interact with the polar silica gel and not move very far, while nonpolar substances will move very far. In gas chromatography (GC), substances are vaporized and run through a packed column, where the time it takes each component to travel through—the retention time—is determined. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is like gas chromatography, but the sample remains in the liquid phase and is pushed through using pressures of up to 400 atmospheres. Ion-exchange chromatography uses stationary phases with acidic or basic functional groups to remove charged compounds; it can be used for water softening.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy (IR) acquires information about the chemical groups present in a compound based on which wavelengths of infrared light the bonds in those groups absorb. When IR-active bonds absorb infrared light, they undergo a change in dipole moment and are excited to a higher-energy vibrational mode, which have names like “stretching,” “wagging,” and “scissoring.” The output of an IR experiment (called an “IR spectrum”) is a graph of absorbance on the y-axis against wavenumbers, measured in cm−1 (inverse centimeters), on the x-axis. The most distinguishable IR peak is that of a carbonyl group, which displays a very strong absorbance at 1700 cm−1, while peaks below 1500 cm−1 produce a complex pattern unique to the compond being analyzed, called the fingerprint region. Samples are typically prepared by grinding them into a potassium bromide pellet or by creating a mull with the oil Nujol.\n\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) uses magnetic fields to determine the arrangement of nuclei in a molecule. Typical NMR methods only work on nuclei that have nonzero spin, such as 1H and 13C—the nonzero spin means that the nuclei oscillate between two spin states in a phenomenon called Larmor precession. NMR measures the frequency at which each nucleus oscillates, whose deviation from a reference nucleus (such as tetramethylsilane) depends on the local electron density and is called the chemical shift. Nuclei that have more electron density (due to proximity to electron-donating groups like alkyl groups) are said to be “shielded” and have lower chemical shifts, while those that have less electron density (due to proximity to electron-withdrawing groups like halogens) are said to be “deshielded” and have higher chemical shifts. Peaks in NMR can be “split” into several peaks due to J-coupling if they are adjacent to identical nuclei, like the three hydrogens of a methyl group. NMR is the theoretical basis for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in medicine.\n\nMass Spectrometry (mass spec or MS) identifies an unknown compound by ionizing it, fragmenting it into pieces, then passing it through electromagnetic fields to separate the pieces based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). A mass spectrum plots the abundance of each fragment aginst the m/z—the spectrum features a base peak (the peak of highest intensity) and a series of peaks whose spacing tells you what elements are present—for instance, a peak spacing of 14 typically indicates a CH2 or methylene unit. The different isotopes of elements can also produce characteristic peak patterns—for instance, two equal-intensity peaks spaced 2 units apart and 79 units away from the next peak indicates bromine. When analyzing proteins, fragmentation is often undesirable, so “soft” ionization methods such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) or electrospray ionization (ESI) are used. In forensics, mass spectrometry is often “coupled” to gas chromatography in GC-MS; gas chromatography first separates the unknown mixture, then mass spec identifies the individual components of the mixture.\n\nUltraviolet-Visible Spectrophotometry (UV-Vis) quantifies the presence of compounds by shining light in the ultraviolet-to-visible range on a molecule, then measuring which wavelengths are absorbed. Parts of a molecule which absorb visible light are referred to as chromophores; since different molecules have different chromophores, the wavelength of maximum absorbance, or lambda-max, can be used to identify a compound. Beer’s law is then used to quantify the concentration of the present compound. Samples are held in small square plastic or quartz tubes called cuvettes. The Woodward-Fieser rules empirically estimate the lambda-max from the types of bonds and functional groups in a molecule. UV-Vis has many uses in biology—for example: calculating the OD600 to measure bacterial growth rate, determining nucleic acid quality with the 260/280 ratio, measuring protein concentration in the Lowry and Bradford protein assays, and monitoring protein folding by measuring tryptophan or tyrosine absorbance.\n\nLiquid-Liquid Extraction separates mixtures based on their relative solubilities in two immiscible solvents, such as oil and water. It is commonly performed by placing the mixture and solvents into a separatory funnel, shaking, then using the stopcock to remove one of the two phases. The partition coefficient quantifies the desired compound’s relative solubility in the two phases. The material left over after the desired material has been extracted is called the raffinate. A variant of liquid-liquid extraction that uses phenol and chloroform as the two solvents is used to isolate DNA from cells."

    "title": "Sandbox And Open-world Video Games",
    "content": "SimCity (Maxis, 1989) The brainchild of designer Will Wright, the title SimCity is a 20th-century American-style city, with players as mayors who have to balance its budget, recover from disasters, and expand commercial, industrial, and residential zones; a green-haired official named Dr. Wright acts as adviser. SimCity foregrounds the gaming concept of “building an engine,” which denotes acquiring good elements that let the player place more such elements and increase the player’s power; in SimCity’s case, building sensible roads and well-placed civic buildings (like schools or power plants) attracts more residents and more tax revenue, unlocking better such buildings. No matter how well or poorly the city is managed, the city can be played for as long as desired with no set end, even if the town is totally bankrupt.\n\nThe Sims (Maxis, 2000) Will Wright made The Sims himself as a “dollhouse-style” simulation game; it was titled The Sims to capitalize on SimCity’s name recognition. Players dictate the lives of people called Sims (telling them, for instance, when to sleep, what to eat, and whom to talk with) in a generic American suburb, with the goal of satisfying their daily human needs while juggling jobs and friendships. Careers are mostly offscreen; The Sims emphasizes domestic life, featuring vast house-building and silly furnishing options and a relationship system that can result in love, fights, jealousy—all spoken in a gibberish language called Simlish. Lauded for appealing to an untapped female market, The Sims spawned a huge franchise even more successful than SimCity.\n\nMinecraft (Mojang, 2011) Currently the best-selling video game of all time, Minecraft’s gameplay is simple: beginning with basic tools, players gather materials (from a world of countless crude, pixel-y Blocks) to craft shelters and structures and craft better tools. Critics often liken Minecraft to playing with a Lego set. There are several modes, with Survival Mode including enemies like Creepers, Endermen, and zombies, while Creative Mode minimizes threats and lets players fly. Across these modes, many Minecraft users have created extremely intricate structures, including detailed re-creations of fictional and real-world buildings and towns. For years, the default player avatar was a blue-shirted man named Steve, but a female avatar named Alex and other custom skins are also now accessible.\n\nNo Man’s Sky (Hello Games, 2016) Hyped for years by director Sean Murray, No Man’s Sky promised galaxies filled with quintillions of procedurally generated planets to explore, all with a multiplayer ability to explore and settle these worlds with friends. However, at launch, reviewers found its early gameplay repetitive and noted no multiplayer mode, with several other aspects oversold or not in place and servers unable to handle the load of active play. These elements (as well as silence from Murray and his team in the weeks after the debut) led to record refund requests and a steep decline in active players. Despite numerous updates that fixed and implemented many promised aspects that prompted a significant critical reassessment in ensuing years, No Man’s Sky is still mostly remembered for its extreme backlash and deeply disappointing debut.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons (Nintendo, 2020) All Animal Crossing games task players with inviting talking animals (from a roster of hundreds) to live in a cute, tiny town; in New Horizons, the town is on a desert island. With an internal game clock tied to real-life date and time, players chop wood, plant flowers, go fishing, and sell fruit to improve the town, but there is no true end or time limit; the game instead emphasizes item collection so players can customize their island to their own satisfaction. Developing the island unlocks a bigger house (provided by the raccoon-like loan shark Tom Nook) and prompts Saturday-night concerts from pop star dog K. K. Slider, but there are no penalties for slow play. New Horizons was fortuitously released in March 2020 amidst COVID lockdown orders, leading many fans to play for hours and visit friends’ islands as a form of escapism.\n\nHitman: Codename 47 (IO Interactive, 2000) In the first installment in the Hitman franchise, players control a bald, barcoded clone known only as Agent 47, employed as an assassin by the shadowy International Contract Association. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, patience, and discretion, and while each level contains physical boundaries, they contain myriad avenues for creativity: missions may be accomplished by any means in countless locations (as direct as strangling a victim or as indirect as having them die in an “accident”). Hitman makes use of very sophisticated AI to manage NPCs (non-player characters), who may witness crimes, discover bodies, and try to kill Agent 47 if the player is sloppy. Hitman was only a middling success; later releases (including a 2016 series reboot) garnered much more acclaim.\n\nGrand Theft Auto III (Rockstar Games, 2001) Grand Theft Auto III was a landmark in video gaming. In one respect, its open-world environment (a New York City spoof called Liberty City) is an unprecedentedly adult playground filled with endless opportunities for mayhem that can be explored at a player’s leisure when not involved in guided missions, which involve the city’s criminal underworld; this detail was augmented by in-game radio stations that play in vehicles. In another respect, GTA III was demonized by parent groups for being racy and hyper-violent—for instance, mini-games called Rampages have players commit mass murder with little consequence. Despite such controversy, GTA III is regarded as one of the greatest games of all time, and it inspired many so-called “GTA clones,” such as Watch Dogs and Saints Row.\n\nAssassin’s Creed (Ubisoft, 2007) Another open-world game with an emphasis on stealth, Assassin’s Creed follows Desmond Miles, a bartender who is kidnapped by the Knights Templar and subjected to a machine that puts Desmond in the mind of one of his ancestors, an Assassin during the Third Crusade. Players must maintain a low profile while exploring versions of Acre, Damascus, and Jerusalem with jumping and wall-scaling abilities heavily informed by the early-2000s parkour craze. Because Desmond is “reliving” the life of his ancestor Altair, any damage the player takes is presented as deviation from “Synchronization,” meaning if Desmond “dies,” the machine stops and restarts him at a previous checkpoint. Assassin’s Creed presents a variety of challenges in these open-world cities, ranging from pickpocketing to interrogations to murders.\n\nFallout 3 (Bethesda Softworks, 2008) After the cult Fallout series was acquired by Bethesda Softworks, Bethesda retooled the mostly isometric third-person RPG series into an open-world first-person action-RPG with Fallout 3. Set in Washington, D.C. centuries after a nuclear apocalypse, the game follows a dweller of a Vault (one of hundreds of underground bunkers manufactured by the megacorporation Vault-Tec) who quests to reunite with his father. With tongue-in-cheek aesthetics drawn from the U.S. post-war era, the game includes a player interface called the Pip-Boy, a clunky wrist-mounted computer. Players have total freedom to explore the region’s ruins and uncover side-quests for unlimited time without progressing the main storyline, encountering recurring franchise factions like monstrous Super Mutants and the fascist Brotherhood of Steel.\n\nRed Dead Redemption (Rockstar Games, 2010) Using a similar format as fellow Rockstar property Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption was instantly hailed as a masterpiece on its release. Its open-world setting depicts the decline of the Wild West, with characters heavily drawn from Spaghetti westerns. The story concerns John Marston, an ex-outlaw whose family is held ransom by the government to force John to track down his old gang. A key component of the game is quickdraw duels, which are aided by “Dead Eye,” an ability that slows down time. In particular, the game is praised for its plot, its desolate yet beautiful visuals, and its music; in particular, the sequence in which players first reach Mexico, set to the song “Far Away,” is often held up as an example of video games as art."

    "title": "Mortal Women In Greek Myth",
    "content": "Pandora (meaning “gifted” or “all gifts”) was the first human woman in Greek mythology. Hephaestus sculpted her from clay as a punishment for humanity after Prometheus stole fire from the gods. The primary myth of Pandora relates how she released all the evils of the world by opening a jar (“Pandora’s Box”), and when she closed the lid only hope remained within. Pandora married the Titan Epimetheus, and their daughter Pyrrha survived the Greek flood with her husband Deucalion.\n\nHelen of Troy was considered the most beautiful mortal woman during the Age of Heroes. Helen was the daughter of Zeus and Leda, and her siblings were Castor, Polydeuces (or Pollux), and Clytemnestra. When Helen married Menelaus, the king of Sparta, Helen’s father Tyndareus forced the Greek kings to swear an oath to fight for her if she were kidnapped. When she was abducted by (or eloped with) Paris, a prince of Troy, the whole Greek world plunged into the Trojan War. For this reason, Christopher Marlowe had Doctor Faustus refer to Helen as “the face that launched a thousand ships.”\n\nMedea was a sorceress from the island of Colchis; her father was King Aeëtes, and her aunt was the witch Circe. Medea encountered the hero Jason when he and the Argonauts came to Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece, and she helped him yoke fire-breathing oxen and sow dragon’s teeth. Medea left Colchis with Jason, and on the voyage home she killed both her brother Absyrtus and the giant bronze automaton Talos. She and Jason had several children together, but Jason ultimately left Medea for the princess Glauce; in vengeance, she killed two of her children and fled on a golden chariot.\n\nPenelope was the ever-faithful wife of Odysseus, the king of Ithaca whose long journey home is the subject of The Odyssey. While Odysseus was away, Penelope was courted by dozens of suitors led by Antinous, but she held them off with cunning: she told them she’d wed one when she finished weaving a burial shroud for Odysseus’s father Laertes, but she unwove her progress each night. When Odysseus returned, she tested his identity by asking the maid to move their bed, which cannot be done since the bed—crafted by Odysseus—had one post that was a living olive tree. Her only child is a son, Telemachus.\n\nArachne was a talented Lydian weaver who constantly boasted that her skills were better than that of any of the gods. Arachne challenged the goddess Athena to a weaving competition, during which Arachne wove a tapestry depicting the gods’ transgressions against mankind and Athena depicted four contests between mortals and the gods. The result of the competition depends on the sources: some say that Arachne won but Athena was insulted by her images and destroyed Arachne’s work, and others say that Athena’s weaving was superior. In all versions, though, Athena turns Arachne into a spider.\n\nClytemnestra was the wife of King Agamemnon and the sister of Castor, Polydeuces, and Helen. When Agamemnon’s troops were stuck at Aulis en route to Troy, he sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia, which made Clytemnestra very angry. She later began an affair with Aegisthus, Agamemnon’s cousin; when Agamemnon returned to Mycenae after the Trojan War, Clytemnestra and Aegisthus murdered him and his concubine Cassandra. In response, Clytemnestra and Agamemnon’s son Orestes killed both Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, continuing the curse of the House of Atreus.\n\nHecuba (or Hekabe) was the wife of King Priam, and therefore the Queen of Troy, during the Trojan War. Her children included Paris—who kidnapped Helen—and Hector, the great Trojan warrior who was slain by Achilles. In Book VI of the Iliad, she leads the Trojan woman in prayer to Zeus on behalf of the Trojan warriors. After the war, Hecuba was grief-stricken upon learning of the death of her youngest daughter Polyxena, and she was given to Odysseus as a slave.\n\nAriadne was the daughter of King Minos and Queen Pasiphaë, making her a princess of Crete. Minos’s palace in Knossos is sometimes referred to as the “dancing ground of Ariadne.” When Theseus came to Crete to kill the Minotaur, Ariadne fell in love with him and gave him a ball of twine to help him navigate the Labyrinth. Ariadne and Theseus left Crete together, but he later abandoned her on the island of Naxos where she was saved by Dionysus, whom she married. Her wedding diadem was placed in the heavens as the constellation Corona Borealis.\n\nAtalanta was a fierce warrior who drew first blood in the Calydonian Boar hunt led by Meleager, who gifted her the Boar’s hide when it was finally killed. Atalanta’s father left her to die on a mountaintop because he wanted a son, but she was saved by a she-bear and later became a hunter of Artemis. According to some sources, Atalanta was also the only female Argonaut. She married Hippomenes after he beat her in a footrace by slowing her down with golden apples given to him by Aphrodite; their son, Parthenopaios, was one of the Seven Against Thebes.\n\nCassandra was a princess of Troy, one of the children of King Priam and Queen Hecuba. She and her twin brother Helenus were both priests of Apollo and thus blessed with the gift of prophecy; however, after Cassandra spurned the advances of Apollo, he cursed her to never have her prophecies believed. During the Trojan War, Cassandra was raped in the Temple of Athena by Ajax the Lesser, which led Athena to wreck his ship on his journey home. After the war, Cassandra was made the concubine of Agamemnon, and the two were killed by Clytemnestra and Aegisthus when they returned to Mycenae.\n\nDanaë was the daughter of King Acrisius of Argos. The king consulted an oracle to ask if he would ever have a son, and the oracle replied that he wouldn’t, but his daughter would, and that grandson would overthrow him. In response, he shut Danaë up in a chamber in his palace, but Zeus appeared in the form of a shower of gold and impregnated her; shortly thereafter, her son Perseus was born. Acrisius then cast Danaë and Perseus out to sea in a chest, but with the assistance of Poseidon they were rescued by the fisherman Dictys. Danaë had no interest in marrying Dictys’s brother King Seriphos, who agreed not to pursue her if Perseus could kill the Gorgon Medusa."

    "title": "Assassinations",
    "content": "On March 15, 44 BC (the Ides of March) Roman statesman Julius Caesar was stabbed 23 times by the Liberatores (“Liberators”), a group of senators led by Gaius Cassius Longinus and Marcus Junius Brutus. Caesar died at the base of the Roman Curia in the Theater of Pompey, just outside the Roman Senate. Caesar had recently been named dictator perpetuo—or “dictator in perpetuity”—which many senators believed would be the end of the Roman Republic. After the assassination, Caesar’s adopted grandnephew Octavian (later Augustus) and his top general Marc Antony formed the Second Triumvirate with Marcus Lepidus; the trio deified Caesar and defeated Brutus and Cassius at the Battle of Philippi.\n\nOn May 4, 1610 King Henry IV of France was stabbed to death by François Ravaillac, a Catholic fanatic who claimed to have had visions instructing him to convince Henry to convert the Huguenots (Protestants) to Catholicism. Ravaillac stabbed Henry—the first French king from the Bourbon Dynasty—on the Rue de la Ferronnerie when the king’s coach stopped in traffic. One of the king’s advisors, Hercule, Duke of Montbazon, was wounded in the attack but survived. Henry IV was survived by his wife Marie de’ Medici, who served as regent for their son Louis XIII until he took power in 1617.\n\nOn April 14, 1865 U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was shot and killed by John Wilkes Booth during a showing of the play Our American Cousin at Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C. Lincoln died the next morning at Petersen House across the street. The assassination was part of a wider plot that included failed attempts to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward. Prior to shooting the president, Booth shouted the Virginia state motto, sic semper tyrannis (“thus always to tyrants”). Booth fled the theater after the attack. After a two-week manhunt, he was found in a barn in northern Virginia, where he refused to surrender and was killed by Union soldier Boston Corbett. Samuel Mudd, a doctor, was controversially imprisoned for treating the broken leg that Booth suffered during his escape.\n\nOn June 28, 1914 Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie were assassinated in Sarajevo by Serbian ultra-nationalist Gavrilo Princip, a member of a secret military society called the Black Hand. In response to the assassination, Austria-Hungary issued the July Ultimatum to Serbia, leading to the outbreak of World War I.\n\nOn January 30, 1948 Indian independence advocate Mohandas Gandhi was shot three times at point-blank range by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist. The shooting occurred just as Gandhi was beginning his daily interfaith service at Birla House in New Delhi. Godse was apprehended by Herbert Reiner Jr., an American diplomat. During his trial, Godse criticized Gandhi’s accepting behavior toward Muslims and blamed Gandhi for the 1947 Partition of India. Gandhi’s death was reported to the nation via radio by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that evening.\n\nOn November 22, 1963 U.S. President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, who targeted the presidential motorcade from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository as the vehicles rode through Dallas’s Dealey Plaza. Texas Governor John Connolly was also severely injured in the shooting, which was captured on tape in the Zapruder film. Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as president aboard Air Force One later that day. Oswald never faced trial for the assassination, as he himself was shot and killed by bar owner Jack Ruby while being transported by federal agents. The Kennedy assassination was investigated by the Warren Commission, led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, which concluded that Oswald was the lone gunman.\n\nOn February 21, 1965 Muslim activist Malcolm X was shot and killed in the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan by three members of the Nation of Islam, an organization that Malcolm X left in March 1964. The assassins were Talmadge Hayer, Norman 3X Butler, and Thomas 15X Johnson. Malcolm X was about to give a speech to the Organization of Afro-American Unity when he was shot 21 times with a shotgun. Many people, including Malcolm X’s widow, have blamed Louis Farrakhan’s harsh rhetoric for inciting the assassination.\n\nOn April 4, 1968 civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed on a balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee by James Earl Ray. King had been in Memphis to show support for a strike by African-American sanitation workers. One notable response to the death of King was the speech given by Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy that night in Indianapolis, in which he quoted the words of the Greek playwright Aeschylus about “pain which cannot forget” that “falls drop by drop upon the heart.”\n\nOn June 5, 1968 Robert F. Kennedy was himself fatally shot by Sirhan Sirhan in Los Angeles. Kennedy was only the second sitting U.S. senator to be assassinated (the other was Huey Long in 1935). The day after winning the California presidential primary, Kennedy was leaving the Ambassador Hotel through the hotel kitchen when he was shot. Following Kennedy’s death, it became policy for the Secret Service to provide protection to presidential candidates during the campaign. The Democratic nomination for 1968 eventually went to Hubert Humphrey, who lost the election to Richard Nixon.\n\nOn October 31, 1984 Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated in New Delhi by two of her Sikh bodyguards: Satwant Singh and Beant Singh. Her murder came four months after Operation Blue Star, a military raid on the sacred Sikh Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab. Gandhi had been on her way to give an interview with British actor Peter Ustinov when she was killed, and the incident led to widespread anti-Sikh riots throughout India in which thousands of Sikhs were killed. Indira Gandhi’s oldest son, Rajiv, succeeded her as Prime Minister of India."

    "title": "Charles Dickens Novels",
    "content": "The Pickwick Papers (1837) The London gentleman Samuel Pickwick, the president of his namesake “club,” sets out with fellow members Nathaniel Winkle, Tracy Tupman, and Augustus Snodgrass on a series of coach journeys to sites in provincial England. While on their travels, the Pickwickians foil the attempt of Alfred Jingle to elope with Rachael Wardle of Dingley Dell. Pickwick also befriends and employs the Cockney valet Sam Weller, who is known for grotesquely humorous sayings such as “out with it, as the father said to his child, when he swallowed a farthing.”\n\nOliver Twist (1838) The orphan Oliver is brought up in a workhouse, where he horrifies the beadle Mr. Bumble by asking for more food. Oliver is then apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry. After fighting with the bully Noah Claypole, Oliver runs away to London. On the road he meets the pickpocket Jack Dawkins, known as the “Artful Dodger,” who leads him to the den of the criminal Fagin. A kindly gentleman named Mr. Brownlow temporarily rescues Oliver, but he is returned to Fagin by the cruel Bill Sikes and the prostitute Nancy. During an attempt to rob a house, Oliver is shot. He is tended by an occupant of the house named Rose Maylie, who eventually learns that Oliver is being plotted against by his villainous half-brother, Monks. The novel ends happily, as Oliver’s chief enemies die or emigrate, and he is left in the care of Mr. Brownlow and Rose, who is revealed to be his aunt.\n\nNicholas Nickleby (1839) After his father dies, Nicholas Nickleby is sent to work at Dotheboys Hall by his cruel uncle Ralph. With the help of the disabled Smike, Nicholas beats the foul schoolmaster Wackford Squeers, and escapes to London. Nicholas’s sister Kate works with the milliner Madame Mantalini, but must confront the attentions of the foppish Mr. Mantalini and Sir Mulberry Hawk. Nicholas finds employment in Portsmouth with the theater manager Vincent Crummles, then returns to London and works for the Cheeryble brothers. Smike dies, and Ralph commits suicide after learning that Smike was his son. Nicholas marries a woman named Madeline Bray, and Kate weds the Cheerybles’ nephew, Frank.\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop (1841) Thirteen-year-old Nell Trent goes to live with her grandfather, a gambling addict who owns a London shop filled with mysterious and horrible objects. His gambling causes him to lose the shop to the evil dwarfish moneylender Daniel Quilp. Nell’s older brother Frederick plots to marry her off to Dick Swiveller to get a share of a supposed treasure trove, but Dick eventually marries a servant girl nicknamed “the Marchioness” instead. A major subplot concerns Quilp’s efforts to frame a boy named Kit Nubbles for theft. At the end of the novel, Quilp drowns, and Nell dies shortly before her grandfather also passes away.\n\nA Christmas Carol (1843) The cold-hearted miser Ebenezer Scrooge is visited on Christmas Eve by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley. Marley’s ghost, who wears heavy chains made of cash boxes and other symbols of greed, tells Scrooge to expect the arrival of three spirits. During a visit from the Ghost of Christmas Past, Scrooge is shown a holiday party given by his former employer Mr. Fezziwig, and is taken back to the moment when his fiancée Belle left him on account of his avarice. The Ghost of Christmas Present takes Scrooge to the homes of his nephew Fred and his clerk Bob Cratchit, whose son Tiny Tim is near death. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows Scrooge the grave of an unloved man—Scrooge himself. Scrooge has a change of heart, celebrates Christmas, and becomes a benefactor to the Cratchit family, preventing Tiny Tim from dying.\n\nDavid Copperfield (1850) Dickens’s favorite of his own books, and the most autobiographical. After David’s father dies, his mother marries the cruel Mr. Murdstone. David is sent to a school where he is tormented by the headmaster Creakle, but finds comfort in his friendships with Tommy Traddles and James Steerforth. While working in London, David befriends the optimistic but indebted Mr. Micawber. Eventually, David escapes his grim warehouse job by walking to Dover. There, he finds his great-aunt Betsey Trotwood, who arranges for David to be educated by the lawyer Mr. Wickfield. David keeps in touch with his old nurse Clara Peggotty, whose relative “Little Em’ly” is seduced and abandoned by David’s former friend Steerforth. Youthful infatuation causes David to wed the flighty Dora Spenlow, who eventually dies. After helping to extricate Mr. Wickfield from the schemes of the “humble” clerk Uriah Heep, David marries Mr. Wickfield’s daughter Agnes. Throughout the story, David progresses in the literary world, ultimately becoming a successful novelist.\n\nBleak House (1853) This novel revolves around the Chancery case Jarndyce and Jarndyce, which has dragged on for many years as family members fight over an inheritance. The title home (which is actually pleasant, rather than bleak) is owned by John Jarndyce, who cares for his young relatives Richard Carstone and Ada Clare. Ada has a companion named Esther Summerson, who narrates much of the novel, and is Dickens’s only female narrator. Esther suffers a severe illness after caring for a sick boy named Jo, and learns that she is the illegitimate daughter of Lady Dedlock. The lawyer Mr. Tulkinghorn discovers Lady Dedlock’s secret but is murdered by the maid Hortense, a crime that is investigated by Inspector Bucket. Lady Dedlock dies after fleeing home and the Chancery suit ends, as the disputed inheritance has been totally consumed by court costs. Other memorable characters in the novel include the merchant Krook, who dies of spontaneous human combustion; Mrs. Jellyby, who busies herself with charitable causes but neglects her own family, and Horace Skimpole, whose blithe irresponsibility burdens others.\n\nHard Times (1854) Thomas Gradgrind is a fact-obsessed utilitarian from Coketown, in the north of England. He superintends a school whose students include an ambitious boy named Bitzer, and Sissy Jupe, a young member of Mr. Sleary’s traveling circus. Mr. Gradgrind arranges for his daughter Louisa to marry Josiah Bounderby, an unpleasant older banker who employs Mr. Grandgrind’s son, Tom. The politician James Harthouse tries to seduce Louisa, who returns home to her father and causes him to see the error of his ways. Tom Gradgrind steals from Mr. Bounderby, unsuccessfully tries to frame a worker named Stephen Blackpool, and flees to America.\n\nA Tale of Two Cities (1859) Paris and London are the title cities of this novel, which famously begins “it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” At the start of the novel, the French doctor Alexandre Manette is released after 18 years in the Bastille, where he was imprisoned to prevent him from revealing the crimes of the Evrémonde family. Dr. Manette relocates to England with the help of his daughter Lucie and the Tellson’s Bank employee Jarvis Lorry. Lucie marries Charles Darnay, a Frenchman who bears a striking resemblance to the English lawyer Sidney Carton. Darnay is also a member of the Evrémonde family. After returning to Paris during the French Revolution, Darnay is arrested as the result of a vendetta against the Evrémondes waged by the Defarges, a proletarian couple who encode information about their enemies into Madame Defarge’s knitting. Carton expresses his love for Lucie by taking Darnay’s place in jail, and goes to the guillotine thinking “it is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done.” Lucie and Darnay escape with the help of the governess Miss Pross, who shoots Madame Defarge.\n\nGreat Expectations (1861) The narrator Philip Pirrip, who is nicknamed “Pip,” is brought up by his sister and her kind husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. While visiting a churchyard, Pip meets the escaped convict Abel Magwitch, and renders him aid. Later, Pip is hired to “play” with a girl named Estella at Satis House, whose owner Miss Havisham was spurned on her wedding day and has worn a wedding dress ever since. When the lawyer Mr. Jaggers reveals that a mysterious benefactor will fund Pip’s education, Pip assumes that Miss Havisham is making him a “gentleman” so that he can marry Estella. Instead, Estella marries the wealthy Bentley Drummle, who mistreats her. Pip discovers that his benefactor was actually the convict Magwitch, and tries to help Magwitch flee England with the help of Pip’s friends Startop and Herbert Pocket. However, the escape is foiled by Compeyson, the man who jilted Miss Havisham. Pip’s great expectations are dashed, but he becomes a better person, and is finally reunited with the widowed Estella. Dickens modified the novel’s conclusion at the suggestion of the author Edward Bulwer-Lytton, who objected to an ending in which Estella weds another man."

    "title": "Rocket Scientists",
    "content": "Robert Goddard was an early explorer of the theory and practice of launching rockets. His work provided the foundation for modern rocketry: in particular, gimballed engines (engines where the exhaust nozzles can change direction allowing the rocket to be steered), fuel pumps, steering with vanes, and gyroscopic stabilization. His seminal monograph on the subject was 1919’s A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes. The next year, he put forward a concept for a rocket launch to the moon that was widely ridiculed in the press as being unrealistic. Goddard is the namesake of the NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland.\n\nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky’s interest in science manifested first through his science fiction writings, but he gained more notoriety for his eponymous rocket equation. The Tsiolkovsky equation, as published in 1903’s Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Device, relates a rocket’s speed with its mass, the speed of its exhaust, and the exhaust’s mass (an application of Newton’s laws of motion.) The equation is also connected with the idea of specific impulse, a measure of a rocket’s efficiency. Tsiolkovsky also published theoretical studies on the capabilities of multi-stage, liquid-fueled engines, gyroscopes, and escape velocities.\n\nHermann Oberth imagined at the age of 14 a recoil rocket, which could propel itself by exhausting gas from its base. He also lends his name to the Oberth effect, a phenomenon by which rockets operate more efficiently when moving at higher speeds, and formulated the idea behind multiple-stage rocketry. Oberth also mentored many German rocket engineers through the Verein für Raumschiffahrt (Spaceflight Society), whose formation was inspired partially by Oberth’s writing.\n\nWernher von Braun was at one time a student of Oberth in the Spaceflight Society. Von Braun is best-known for leading Nazi Germany’s development and construction of the V-2 rocket (literally, “vengeance weapon”), which wreaked destruction on southern England during World War II. After World War II, he was recruited to the US as part of Operation Paperclip, and proposed to launch a space station carrying a nuclear arsenal (though he hedged the concept as “particularly dreadful”). He presided over Mercury-Redstone development as Director of NASA’s newly-opened Marshall Spaceflight Center, which produced the rockets used in the Mercury spaceflights, and the Saturn V rocket used to launch the Apollo spacecraft.\n\nHellmuth Walter designed the Starthilfe (takeoff assist) rocket propulsion units for the Messerschmidt Me 163 and the vertical-takeoff Bachem Ba 349 aircrafts, used by the German Luftwaffe in World War II. He also was awarded a patent in 1925 for suggesting that a catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide could provide oxygen for combustion.\n\nSergei Korolev, known until his death by the pseudonym “Chief Designer”, headed design and construction for the Soviet long-range ballistic missile program, as well as the R-7 ICBM program. This work urged similar innovations in the U.S. Earlier in his career, Korolev designed a rocket-powered glider, though he was imprisoned and forced into slave labor during the Great Purge. In the 1950s, he personally oversaw Sputnik and Sputnik 2, and he returned to the R-7, modifying it for lunar insertion of robotic probes. His final years were spent devising soft-landing methods for manned lunar missions.\n\nTheodore von Kármán was a fluid dynamicist by training. As a graduate student at Göttingen, he described the so-called Kármán vortex street (a form of turbulence in flow going past a cylinder, which is responsible for driving the vibration or “singing” of power lines) and went on to provide the theoretical basis for the idea of turbulent flows. He contributed to the construction of the wind tunnel at the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, which eventually became the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He also formed the company Aerojet to develop short-takeoff aircraft technologies. The Kármán line is the accepted boundary between the Earth’s atmosphere and outer space, and the Kármán ogive is the shape of the cone of rockets curving into the main body, which minimizes drag during rocket burn.\n\nGene Kranz was a trained aeronautical engineer and pilot. He is best known for his Flight Directorship during the Mercury and Apollo projects. He presided over a departure from NASA’s traditional incremental testing structure, in favor of a more aggressive, manned campaign (“all-up testing”). As part of the Apollo 13 “white team,” Kranz and his associates engineered the free-return trajectory and human-factors management that brought the Apollo 13 crew back safely after a near-fatal spacecraft anomaly.\n\nHomer Hickam was inspired by seeing Sputnik fly overhead to study rocketry in his early teens. From his coal-company town in West Virginia, he and his rocket club, The Big Creek Missile Agency, designed modest-sized rockets and won the propulsion category of the 1960 National Science Fair. After serving in Vietnam, Hickam worked at the US Army Missile Command in Germany and Huntsville. Later, he moved to NASA, where he specialized in astronaut training. He trained crews for the Hubble Space Telescope’s deployment extra-vehicular activity (EVA) and the first two servicing missions."

    "title": "Photography Pioneers",
    "content": "Louis Daguerre and Joseph Nicéphore Niépce functionally invented photography as we know it. Niépce created the process of heliography, which he used to create View from the Window at Le Gras, the oldest surviving photograph of a real-world scene. Daguerre, another pioneer, partnered with Niépce and the two developed the physautotype method, which used lavender oil. After Niépce’s death, Daguerre developed an even faster process, in which an iodized silver plate was exposed to light, treated with mercury fumes, and “fixed” with a solution of sodium thiosulfate; that process, daguerreotypy, bears his name.\n\nEadweard Muybridge initially gained fame in the 1860s for his photographs of Yosemite Valley, published under the alias “Helios,” but is now likely more famous for helping Leland Stanford—the governor of California—settle an argument regarding whether a racehorse ever has all four feet off the ground during a gallop. Muybridge eventually did this to the satisfaction of the public with a series of tripwire-triggered cameras; the series of photos thus created was later exhibited in the form of a zoopraxiscope, an early motion-picture device Muybridge also invented. Muybridge also shot and killed his wife’s lover, Major Harry Larkyns. He was acquitted on the basis of justifiable homicide, and the trial was later dramatized in Philip Glass’s opera The Photographer.\n\nAuguste and Louis Lumière were brothers who invented an improved cinematograph, which made them very early pioneers in the film industry. However, they were also important in the history of still photography, as their autochrome process was the first widely used technique that produced color photographs.\n\nGeorge Eastman’s invention of a dry-plate process improved the robustness of photographs, which he then built further on by developing a gelatin emulsion that was applied to paper, then removed and varnished with collodion after exposure. This film, which was carried in rolls, was easier to transport than plates and allowed for multiple exposures without fully reloading a camera. Eastman’s crowning achievement was the compact, handheld Kodak camera.\n\nEdwin Land initially made his name developing filters for polarizing light. He then developed the instant, self-developing film, which worked by squeezing the negative film against a positive sheet, then using a reagent to transfer and quickly develop the image. The first commercially viable instant camera was produced and sold in 1948 by Land’s Polaroid Corporation.\n\nHarold “Doc” Edgerton, a longtime member of the MIT faculty, gained the nickname “Papa Flash” for developing techniques to capture fast-moving events using synchronized multiflash photography, with the help of a previously-obscure piece of lab equipment called the stroboscope.\n\nMatthew Brady studied under Samuel Morse, who popularized the daguerreotype in America, and became a portrait photographer in New York. When the Civil War broke out, Brady saw it as a potential source of memorabilia, and took photos at Bull Run in a mobile darkroom. His work expanded to hiring out crews of photographers to cover the entire war, essentially creating the practice of photojournalism. Brady himself took portrait photos of prominent figures of both sides.\n\nMargaret Bourke-White was hired by Henry Luce to work for Fortune magazine, but became known for her work for Life, including the magazine’s first cover. a picture of Fort Peck Dam. She and her future husband, the author Erskine Caldwell, produced the book You Have Seen Their Faces, a survey of sharecroppers in the South. Bourke-White was later a World War II correspondent, and her pictures of the concentration camps at Buchenwald and Erla broadcast the tragedy back to the U.S. She also interviewed and photographed Mohandas Gandhi before his assassination.\n\nThe Farm Security Administration photographers during the Great Depression documented the plight of poor farmers. Dorothea Lange may have produced the single most enduring image among them, a portrait of Florence Owens Thompson staring worriedly into the middle distance as two of her children bury their faces in her neck, called Migrant Mother. Walker Evans, another FSA photographer, collaborated with writer James Agee on a study of three sharecropping families in Alabama, called Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. Gordon Parks, whose photo of an FSA cleaning woman was both posed and titled in ironic homage to Grant Wood’s American Gothic, was a pioneering African-American photographer who later directed the film Shaft.\n\nAnsel Adams, like Muybridge, gained significant fame for his photographs of Yosemite National Park, including Moon and Half Dome. With Willard Van Dyke and Edward Weston, he founded Group f/64, named after the smallest common aperture setting of cameras at the time. He also developed a method to determine the optimum exposure for a negative, known as the Zone System, enabling him to create tremendous detail within small gradation of shade in black-and-white photography.\n\nAlfred Stieglitz pioneered the artistic style of photography and founded the journal Camera Work. After a fight over the importance of pictorialism with the National Arts Club, he founded the Photo-Secession movement. The husband of painter Georgia O’Keefe, Stieglitz also founded the Little Galleries of the Photo Secession at 291 Fifth Avenue, New York City, which became known as simply “291.”\n\nEdward Steichen was a member of the Photo-Secession movement. He was heavily featured in Camera Work and helped Stieglitz found 291. Steichen later abandoned pictorial photography and worked for Vogue and Vanity Fair, where he produced some of the first fashion photographs. He later served as the director of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art, where he organized the exhibition The Family of Man.\n\nMan Ray worked with Marcel Duchamp on a series of readymades before taking up photography. His earliest works were darkroom experiments in exposure called “rayographs.” His later photographic work tended toward surrealism; perhaps the most prominent example is his Violon d’Ingres, a photograph of the model Kiki de Montparnasse with the f-holes from a violin superimposed on her back. With his assistant Lee Miller, Man Ray also rediscovered the technique of solarization.\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson, who with Robert Capa and several others founded the cooperative Magnum Photos, was a master of candid photography who conceived of the goal of photography as the capture of the “decisive moment.” His most famous photograph, an encapsulation of his philosophy, shows a man leaping from a ladder over a puddle behind the Gare Saint-Lazare train station in Paris.\n\nRobert Mapplethorpe came to prominence thanks to his portraits of his longtime friend, the musician Patti Smith. He produced many celebrity portraits and still-life images of flowers, but is likely most famous for his homoerotic work depicting the BDSM subculture of 1970s New York. Shortly after his 1989 death from AIDS complications, his exhibition “The Perfect Moment” culminated in a 1990 obscenity trial in Cincinnati.\n\nCindy Sherman made a series of Untitled Film Stills, consisting largely of self-portraits posed in the style a B-movie actress, which began a series of photos in which she modified popular photographic forms to respond to the stereotyping of women in the media. Her later series Fairy Tales and Disasters began including mannequins and prosthetic limbs, which she also used as the subject of her “Sex Pictures.”\n\nAndreas Gursky, whose work tends to feature high vantage points and scenes that produce horizontal bands of color, has taken some of the most expensive photographs ever sold. Among those are his 99 Cent II Diptychon, a shot of the shelves of a 99-cent store, and Rhein II, a photograph of the Rhine River with humans and buildings digitally edited out."

    "title": "Medieval Battles",
    "content": "Tours (732): The Franks’ victory at the Battle of Tours was a major turning point in the history of Europe. After conquering Iberia, the Umayyads advanced into France as far as Poitiers. The Franks were led by Charles Martel, while the Umayyads were led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. The battle was preceded by a pact between the Berber governor Munuza and Odo, Duke of Aquitaine, though Odo was present at Tours. The best contemporary source for the battle is the Mozarabic Chronicle of 754.\n\nHastings (1066): A little more than two weeks after Stamford Bridge, Harold Godwinson was defeated by another claimant to the throne of England at Hastings. That claimant was Duke William of Normandy, who is now known as William the Conqueror. The battle and Harold’s death are depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry. The battle took place two weeks after William’s landing at Pevensey.\n\nManzikert (1071): The Byzantine defeat at Manzikert (Malazgirt in Turkish) by the Seljuk Turks was a severe blow to the Byzantine empire’s control of Anatolia. The Seljuks were led by Alp Arslan, while Emperor Romanus IV led the Byzantines. The Byzantines split their forces in half before the battle by sending general Joseph Tarchaneiotes to Khliat, and were further weakened by the desertion of Andronicus Dukas. The Byzantine emperor was captured in the battle, but released by Alp Arslan after signing a peace treaty. Romanus IV was later deposed and blinded.\n\nLas Navas de Tolosa (1212): Las Navas de Tolosa was a major turning point in the Reconquista of the Iberian peninsula. A Christian alliance of Alfonso VIII of Castile, Sancho VII of Navarre, Afonso II of Portugal, and Peter II of Aragon defeated Muhammad al-Nasir and the Almohads.\n\nLake Peipus (1242): The Russian victory at this battle ended territorial claims of the Teutonic Knights on Russian soil. The Russians were led by Alexander Nevsky and Andrey Yaroslavich, while the Livonian Order (a branch of the Teutonic Order) was led by Hermann of Dorpat. It is also known as the Battle on the Ice because it was fought on frozen Lake Peipus.\n\nBannockburn (1314): The Battle of Bannockburn was a decisive victory for Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, over King Edward II of England. The English attempted to lift the siege of Stirling Castle. The battle began with single combat between Robert the Bruce and Sir Henry de Bohun. The Earl of Moray commanded the Scottish vanguard near the Church of St. Ninian.\n\nKosovo (1389): This battle between Serbians and Ottomans eventually led to the subjugation of Serbia. Both Prince Lazar of Serbia and Sultan Murad I died during the battle. Bayezid I, who was present at the battle, became the Ottoman Sultan once his father died.\n\nGrunwald/Tannenberg (1410): The Battle of Grunwald marked a major turning point in Eastern European history as it led to the decline of the Teutonic Knights and the rise of Poland-Lithuania. Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen led the Teutonic Knights, and King Władysław II Jagiello led Polish forces and Grand Duke Vytautas led the Lithuanians. After their defeat, the Teutonic Knights held out in Marienburg Castle until the Peace of Thorn in 1411.\n\nAgincourt (1415): The outnumbered army of King Henry V of England defeated the army of King Charles VI of France under Charles d’Albret. French commanders Jean le Maingre and Charles d’Orleans were captured. The battle occurred about one month after the English victory at the Siege of Harfleur. Five years after Agincourt, Henry was recognized as the heir to the French throne through the Treaty of Troyes.\n\nConstantinople (1453): Constantinople fell to the Ottomans on May 29, 1453 after a seven-week siege. The Byzantine defenders were led by Emperor Constantine XI and a Genoese captain named Giovanni Giustiniani, and the Ottomans were led by Sultan Mehmed II and Zaganos Pasha. Preparations for the siege included the building of Rumeli Hisar across from Anadolu Hisar on the Bosphorus. The defenders stretched a chain across the Golden Horn, but the Ottomans rolled their ships over Galata Hill on greased logs to encircle the city."

    "title": "Non-shakespeare Classical English Dramas",
    "content": "The Spanish Tragedy (or, Hieronimo is Mad Again) (Thomas Kyd, c. 1585): A sensational hit when it was first performed, The Spanish Tragedy pioneered and popularized the gory genre known as the revenge tragedy. The play is set in the wake of a war between Portugal and Spain, during which the Spanish soldier Don Andrea was killed by the Portuguese prince Balthazar. After Andrea’s death, Balthazar was captured by two Spanish soldiers: Lorenzo, the nephew of the King of Spain; and Horatio, the capable son of the marshal Hieronimo. As the play begins, Andrea’s ghost has returned to Earth along with the spirit of Revenge, to watch the events that will lead to Balthazar’s death. Those events are put in motion by Andrea’s former lover Bel-imperia, who falls in love with Horatio and rejects the smitten Balthazar. Lorenzo and Balthazar then conspire to kill Horatio, whose death devastates Hieronimo. Bel-imperia is imprisoned by Lorenzo to cover up the crime, but sends a letter written in her own blood to Hieronimo, exposing Lorenzo’s schemes. During a climactic play-within-a-play, Hieronimo and Bel-imperia take vengeance by stabbing Lorenzo and Balthazar, and subsequently kill themselves. The Spanish Tragedy is noted for its influence on the works of Shakespeare, especially the incriminating play-within-a-play in Hamlet.\n\nThe Jew of Malta (Christopher Marlowe, c. 1589): After his massive fortune is seized by Malta’s governor, Ferneze, to pay tribute to the Turks, the Jewish merchant Barabas embarks on a complex journey of revenge. Barabas uses his daughter Abigail to spark a jealous feud that leads to a duel in which the governor’s son Lodowick is killed. Abigail then hides in a convent and converts to Christianity, leading Barabas and his slave Ithamore to poison all of the convent’s occupants. Barabas eventually aids the Turks in conquering Malta, for which he is appointed governor, but betrays the Turks in favor of the Maltese, who kill Barabas in a boiling cauldron as they retake the island. The Jew of Malta is thought to have influenced Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice.\n\n(The Tragical History of the Life and Death of) Doctor Faustus (Christopher Marlowe, c. 1593): Two scholars named Valdes and Cornelius teach Faustus how to summon a demon, which Faustus promptly does, conjuring Mephistophilis. Faustus then signs his soul over to Lucifer, in exchange for 24 years of healthy life with Mephistophilis as his dutiful servant. Faustus constantly rejects the pleas of an angel to accept the forgiveness of God, instead traveling and gaining worldly fame. At one point, he summons the “shade” of Helen of Troy, and exclaims “was this the face that launch’d a thousand ships, and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?” On the night his deal is scheduled to expire, a clock’s chimes announce that Faustus is running out of time to repent. He never does, so devils appear and drag him to hell.\n\nEvery Man in His Humour (Ben Jonson, 1598): Set in Jonson’s contemporary London, this comedy is a “humours play,” in which each character is a stock type governed by a corresponding “humour” (as theorized in Greek medicine). The plot chiefly concerns Knowell, an old gentleman who worries that his son Edward is becoming too involved with Wellbred, a fun-loving gallant Londoner. Knowell secretly follows his son to London; meanwhile, Wellbred’s brother-in-law, the merchant Kitely, worries that Wellbred’s behavior will give his business a bad reputation, all the while suspecting his own wife of infidelity. Various subplots involve Knowell’s mischievous servant Brainworm, the braggart-captain Bobadill, and two friends of Wellbred who try to be fashionably and poetically melancholic. In the end, the kindly Justice Clement settles all of the grievances amassed over the course of the play. A follow-up, Every Man Out of His Humour, was written one year later.\n\nVolpone (Ben Jonson, 1605): Each character in this Jonson play is based on an animal archetype. The greedy Venetian noble Volpone (named for the Italian for “fox”) cajoles gifts from men named Corbaccio (“raven”), Corvino (“crow”), and Voltore (“vulture”) by faking a fatal illness, and separately promising his fortune to each man. At the urging of Volpone’s servant Mosca (“fly”), Corbaccio agrees to disinherit his own son Bonario by writing a new will that will name Volpone as sole heir. Volpone also engages in stratagems to sleep with Corvino’s wife Celia, although his attempt to rape her is foiled by Bonario. In a subplot, the English traveler Peregrine humiliates a foolish fellow countryman named Sir Politick Would-Be. After a trial, Volpone fakes his death and names Mosca his sole heir; Mosca’s ensuing behavior prompts Volpone to reveal himself, resulting in the punishment of all wrongdoing.\n\nThe Duchess of Malfi (John Webster, 1613): This play is a product of the Jacobean period, in which the thrilling, macabre, and fantastic were prevalent on stage. The play follows the widowed Duchess, who loves Antonio Bologna, a good-hearted nobleman below her station. Her twin brother Ferdinand denounces her affection for Antonio out of incestuous envy. Her other brother, a Cardinal, hires the former galley-slave Bosola to spy on her. Bosola discovers the Duchess and Antonio have married (and had children), so the Cardinal sends them into exile. Ferdinand subsequently imprisons the Duchess, terrorizes her with asylum patients, and arranges for her to see statues resembling the dead bodies of her husband and children. Executioners sent by Ferdinand then kill the Duchess and her maid Cariola. Paranoia overtakes both brothers; the Cardinal kills his mistress Julia with a poisoned bible, and Ferdinand imagines he has become a werewolf. Bosola, disgusted by his own actions, tries to murder the Cardinal but mistakenly kills Antonio instead. In a climactic confrontation, Bosola, the Cardinal, and Ferdinand all kill each other, leaving the son of the Duchess and Antonio to inherit what remains.\n\nAll for Love (or, the World Well Lost) (John Dryden, 1677): Dryden wrote that he “professed to imitate the divine Shakespeare” in this play, which retells the story of the Roman leader Mark Antony and the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. In Dryden’s version of the tale, the Roman general Ventidius actively tries to separate the two lovers, and encourages Antony to believe that Cleopatra has been secretly consorting with the Roman Dolabella. Another of the central characters in Dryden’s play is Antony’s wife Octavia, who travels to Alexandria to convince Antony to reconcile. At the end of the play, the eunuch Alexas falsely tells Antony that Cleopatra has committed suicide. Antony falls upon his sword, and the grief-stricken Cleopatra lets herself be bitten by a poisonous snake. The dead lovers are then eulogized by Serapion, a priest of Isis.\n\nThe Way of the World (William Congreve, 1700): The Way of the World’s complex plot (typical of Restoration comedy) concerns Mirabell and Millimant, two lovers who wish to marry. However, Millimant will lose “half her fortune” unless her choice of husband is approved by her aunt Lady Wishfort, who wants her to marry Sir Wilfull Witwoud. Mirabell enlists the married servants Waitwell and Foible to trick Lady Wishfort into falling in love with Sir Rowland, who is actually Waitwell in disguise, so that the compromised Lady Wishfort will be forced to agree to Mirabell and Millamant’s marriage. The scheme is supported by Lady Wishfort’s daughter, Mrs. Fainall, but exposed by a woman named Mrs. Marwood, who loves Mirabell. A resolution is reached when the rakish Mr. Fainall tries to blackmail his mother-in-law Lady Wishfort, who asks for Mirabell’s help. Mirabell then produces an old contract that invalidates the blackmail attempt, securing Lady Wishfort’s blessing for his marriage to Millamant.\n\nShe Stoops to Conquer (or, The Mistakes of a Night) (Oliver Goldsmith, 1773): In this enduringly popular comedy, a wealthy gentleman’s son named Charles Marlow is sent to visit the country home of Mr. Hardcastle, who has a beautiful daughter named Kate. On the way, Marlow and his companion George Hastings stop at an alehouse where Kate’s half-brother, Tony Lumpkin, tricks them into thinking they are miles from their destination. Tony directs the travelers to Mr. Hardcastle’s house, claiming it is an inn. There, Marlow and Hastings rudely treat the Hardcastles as innkeepers, which the Hardcastles patiently endure for the sake of their friendship with Marlow’s wealthy father. At the same time, Kate discovers that Marlow is timid and reserved around high-born ladies, but is rakishly charming to lower-class women. Kate therefore “stoops” to impersonating a barmaid in order to woo Marlow. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hardcastle attempts to make her niece Constance Neville marry Tony. Constance, however, is secretly engaged to Hastings, and the pair try to obtain a casket of jewels that belongs to Constance, but which Mrs. Hardcastle carefully guards. In the end, Kate wins Marlow, and Tony discovers that he is older than the Hardcastles have led him to believe. Upon discovering he is an adult, Tony refuses the arranged marriage, freeing Constance to marry Hastings.\n\nThe Rivals (Richard Brinsley Sheridan, 1775): Like Sheridan’s later play The School for Scandal, The Rivals offers a satirical take on manners and courtship. The play’s heroine is Lydia Languish, a wealthy heiress who loves reading novels, and who wants her own life to imitate the tropes of romantic fiction. To win Lydia’s heart, the wealthy Captain Jack Absolute pretends to be the impoverished “Ensign Beverley.” Lydia is also desired by the “country gentleman” Bob Acres and the Irish baronet Sir Lucius O’Trigger, the latter of whom sends letters via the maid Lucy. However, O’Trigger’s letters are actually read and answered by Lydia’s guardian Mrs. Malaprop, who is infatuated with O’Trigger and uses the pseudonym “Delia” in her correspondence. (Mrs. Malaprop’s comical speech patterns gave rise to the English word “malapropism,” which refers to the accidental substitution of one word for another that sounds similar, but has a different meaning.) Jack’s father Sir Anthony Absolute eventually exposes Jack’s deception, infuriating Lydia. Jack then has an abortive duel with Sir Lucius, leading Mrs. Malaprop to admit that she is “Delia.” At the end of the play, Lydia and Jack reconcile, as do their friends, the quarreling lovers Julia and Faulkland."

    "content": "Gayane (1942) by Aram Khachaturian. Gayane tells the story of the title heroine, who lives on a cooperative farm (kolkhoz) in Khachaturian’s native Armenia with her husband Giko and her father Ovanes, who heads the collective. Giko, a lazy alcoholic, repeatedly beats and abuses the hard-working Gayane. However, Gayane escapes the marriage when she reveals Giko to be an anti-Soviet spy, leading to his arrest; Gayane then marries the soldier Kazakov. The most famous excerpt from Gayane is the frenetic “Sabre Dance,” originally part of a group of dances in the final act meant to represent the various Soviet republics. Other notable music from the ballet includes an adagio movement, meant to represent carpet weavers, that was used in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nLa Péri (The Peri) (1912) by Paul Dukas. La Péri, the last major work by Paul Dukas, tells the story of Iksender (Alexander the Great), who is searching Iran for the Flower of Immortality. He finally finds it at the Ends of the Earth, where it is in the hands of a sleeping Péri (a mythical fairy-like creature from Persian folklore). When Iksender tries to steal the flower, he awakens the Péri, who needs the flower to commune with Ormuzd (the Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazda). The Péri seduces Iksender, who realizes that he doesn’t deserve the flower. He surrenders it to the spirit, who ascends to Paradise, leaving him to die alone on Earth. The opening fanfare is often performed independently of the rest of the suite.\n\nPetrushka (1911, revised 1947) by Igor Stravinsky. Petrushka has a framing story with opening and closing scenes at a Shrovetide fair. The main story is about three puppets: Petrushka, the Ballerina, and the Moor, who are brought to life by the Magician (in some translations, the Charlatan). Petrushka falls in love with the Ballerina, who is smitten with the Moor. The love triangle ends with the Moor killing Petrushka with an axe after the “Dance of the Wet-Nurses” and the “Dance of the Peasant and Bear.” The Magician claims that no harm was done, since Petrushka is only a puppet, but at the ballet’s end Petrushka’s ghost appears and haunts the Magician. Musically, it is most famous for its “Petrushka chord,” a dissonant combination of C-major and F-sharp-major triads played by the clarinets.\n\nPulcinella (1920) by Igor Stravinsky. Pulcinella is usually regarded as the first work of Stravinsky’s neoclassical period. Choreographed by Léonide Massine, it was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev. Diaghilev wanted to update a commedia dell’arte play attributed at the time to Giovanni Pergolesi (that attribution has recently been challenged). The one-act ballet tells the story of Pulcinella, a stock character of commedia dell’arte, and his lover Pimpinella, as well as two girls, Prudenza and Rosetta, and their suitors, Florindo and Cloviello. Pulcinella kisses Rosetta after she dances for him, enraging Pimpinella as well as the two suitors, who — jealous of Pulcinella — beat him up and appear to kill him. However, the “body” of Pulcinella is actually his friend Furbo, who impersonated Pulcinella and played dead. Pulcinella, disguised as a magician, appears, reveals himself, and marries Pimpinella, who forgives him.\n\nThe Rite of Spring (Le Sacre du Printemps or Vesna svyashchennaya) (1913) by Igor Stravinsky. The Rite of Spring, subtitled “Pictures of Pagan Russia,” was written for the Ballets Russes, and choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky. Inspired by Russian folklorist Nicholas Roerich, who designed the original sets, it is in two parts, “The Adoration of the Earth” and “The Sacrifice.” It opens with a high-pitched bassoon solo based on a Lithuanian folk song, which is followed by the dissonant “Augurs of Spring” (sometimes called “Dances of the Young Girls”), which features E-major and E-flat-major chords superimposed on each other and played with seemingly random accents. The piece ends with a girl forced to dance herself to death. Changes of meter are frequent, sometimes changing measure to measure. The original instrumentation featured several unusual percussion instruments, including a gong, tambourines, antique cymbals, and the guiro. Most infamously, a riot broke out at its Paris premiere, although contemporary reports give differing accounts on the Rite’s role.\n\nRodeo (1942) by Aaron Copland. Agnes DeMille choreographed Rodeo and danced the lead role at its premiere. It tells the story of a tomboy Cowgirl in the American West (the characters are not given specific names). She falls in love with the Head Wrangler, who prefers the more feminine Rancher’s Daughter. The Cowgirl winds up dancing and eventually kissing the Champion Roper, who earlier competed for the Rancher’s Daughter’s hand. Rodeo is split into five sections: “Buckaroo Holiday,” which introduces the characters; “Corral Nocturne,” in which the oboe and bassoon depict the Cowgirl’s loneliness; “Ranch House Party,” which was omitted from the orchestral version; “Saturday Night Waltz”; and “Hoe-down,” which is based on the folk song “Bonaparte’s Retreat.” “Hoe-down” was famously used in the “Beef: It’s What’s for Dinner” ad campaign in the 1990s.\n\nRomeo and Juliet (1938) by Sergei Prokofiev. Prokofiev composed Romeo and Juliet for the Bolshoi Ballet. Prokofiev originally intended to substitute a happier ending for Shakespeare’s tragic one — stating “dead people cannot dance” — but conductor Yuri Fayer talked him out of it (in significant part for political reasons). The “Dance of the Knights” (also called “Montagues and Capulets”) is an often-excerpted portion of the ballet noted for its pulsating, driving rhythm, while the Gavotte, or “Departure of the Guests,” reuses a theme from Prokofiev’s First Symphony (the “Classical”). The score, which calls for such nonstandard instruments as a tenor saxophone, maracas, tambourine, and celesta, was later transformed into three orchestral suites, as well as a set of ten works for solo piano. (The score underwent further revisions — not by Prokofiev himself — in 1940; choreographer Mark Morris has performed Prokofiev’s original version with the “happier” ending.)\n\nSleeping Beauty (Spyashchaya krasavitsa) (1890) by Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky. Choreographed by Marius Petipa, Sleeping Beauty (also called The Sleeping Beauty) is based on the fairy tale of the same name, though other fairy tale figures — including Little Red Riding Hood and Cinderella — appear. Split into four sections (“The Christening,” “The Spell,” “The Vision,” and “The Wedding”), Sleeping Beauty relates the story of Princess Aurora, the daughter of King Florestan XXIV. He invites a group of fairies to Aurora’s christening, but the evil spirit Carabosse, furious at not being invited, appears and curses Aurora to die on her 16th birthday by pricking her finger with a spindle. However, the powerful Lilac Fairy weakens the curse, so that Aurora will sleep for a hundred years instead. On her 16th birthday, the townspeople perform the “Garland Waltz” and four suitors and Aurora perform the challenging “Rose Adagio.” A mysterious figure (Carabosse in disguise) appears and gives Aurora a spindle, on which Aurora pricks herself and falls asleep; the Lilac Fairy then expands the spell over the entire kingdom. A century later, Prince Desire is hunting in the forest when the Lilac Fairy approaches him and leads him to the castle. He wakes Aurora with a kiss and wins her hand in marriage.\n\nSwan Lake (Lebedinoye ozero) (1867) by Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky. Many modern performances of Swan Lake are based on a revised version of Tchaikovsky’s score prepared after Tchaikovsky’s death by Marius Petipa, Lev Ivanov, and Riccardo Drigo. The ballet opens at Prince Siegfried’s 21st birthday party, where Siegfried’s mother scolds him for not finding a wife; she plans for him to choose a spouse at a ball the following evening. After the “Dance of the Goblets,” Siegfried, his tutor Wolfgang, and his friend Benno go hunting. They are about to shoot a swan when it turns into the beautiful Odette. Odette reveals she was cursed by the sorcerer von Rothbart to turn into a swan during the daytime. The curse can only be broken if one who has never loved before declares his love for her. Odette and the other victims of von Rothbart’s curse live on the title lake, which was created by Odette’s mother’s tears. Their presence is usually signified by one of the ballet’s recurring musical themes, a B-minor motif for oboe and harp. Odette and Siegfried begin to fall in love, but morning breaks and Odette returns to her swan form. At the palace, the ball begins with nationalistic dances, including Neapolitan and Hungarian dances and a mazurka. Von Rothbart arrives with his daughter Odile, disguised to look like Odette. (Odette and Odile are normally played by the same ballerina, who wears white as Odette and black as Odile.) They successfully trick Siegfried into declaring his love for Odile, dooming Odette to live as a swan forever. He hurries back to the lake, where he and Odette drown themselves, killing von Rothbart in the process. The exact ending varies from production to production, with some happier than others.\n\nThe Three-Cornered Hat (El sombrero de tres picos) (1919) by Manuel de Falla. Sergei Diaghilev commissioned this ballet based on a novella by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón; the costumes were designed by Pablo Picasso. The title headgear is worn by the ballet’s main villain, a magistrate (corregidor), who attempts to seduce the main female character, a miller’s wife. The miller and his wife then trick the magistrate: the miller’s wife flirtatiously offers the magistrate some grapes, but then leads him on a chase past the miller, hiding in a bush, who beats the magistrate. That night, the magistrate sends a deputy to arrest the miller on falsified charges; after the arrest, the opening of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony plays to signify the “knocking of fate.” The magistrate goes to the miller’s home, but falls into a river, causing the miller’s wife to flee. The magistrate then undresses and gets into the miller’s bed; the miller, having escaped from prison, decides to seduce the magistrate’s wife and secretly switches clothes with him. The magistrate, dressed in the miller’s clothes, is then arrested by his deputy. The miller and his wife arrive and toss the magistrate up and down in a blanket."

    "title": "Early 20th-century Art Movements",
    "content": "Fauvism (c. 1905) Upon seeing a number of Fauvist paintings in the same room as a classical sculpture at the 1905 Salon d’Automne exhibit, critic Louis Vauxcelles described the sculpture as “Donatello chez les fauves” (“a Donatello amongst wild beasts”), thus coining the art movement’s name with an insult. To maximize the expressiveness of their canvases, Fauves disregarded figure modeling and color harmonies in favor of large brushstrokes with broad flat areas of violently contrasting colors. The poorly received Fauves — accused by critic Camille Mauclair of “flinging a pot of paint in the face of the public,” an accusation first leveled by John Ruskin against James Whistler — were led by Henri Matisse, whose Woman with a Hat (a portrait of his wife, who is also depicted in his The Green Stripe) was singled out for attacks before being purchased by Gertrude and Leo Stein. Other Fauves include André Derain (Charing Cross Bridge, Houses of Parliament at Night) — who co-founded the movement with Matisse — Raoul Dufy (Regatta at Cowes), Maurice de Vlaminck (The River Seine at Chatou), and Kees van Dongen (Woman with Large Hat). Fauvism died out almost entirely by 1908.\n\nExpressionism (1905–1930s) Originating in Germany at the start of the 20th century, Expressionism sought to present the world from a purely subjective perspective, shaping images to maximize emotional effect and evoke certain moods or ideas. As such, Expressionists favored meaning and emotional experience over physical reality. Two major sub-movements of Expressionism were The Bridge (Die Brücke) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter): The Bridge (Die Brücke) (1905) Founded by Ernst Kirchner in Dresden, Die Brücke is so named because members of the movement saw themselves as the bridge between traditional and modern painting. Inspired by Fauvism, members of The Bridge followed similar ideals, utilizing violent juxtapositions of color; however, paintings of The Bridge were noticeably more intense, reflecting emotional agitation through scenes of city streets and sexually charged events in country settings. Besides Kirchner (Street, Dresden, Playing Naked People, Bathers at Moritzburg), other prominent members of The Bridge include Erich Heckel (Bathers in the Reeds, Weisses Haus in Dangast), Karl Schmidt-Rotluff (Woman with a Bag, The Factory), Fritz Bleyl, Emil Nolde (Blumengarten), Max Pechstein (Under the Trees), and Otto Mueller (Landscape with Yellow Nudes). The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter) (1911) So named because of the founders’ love for horses and the color blue (and the namesake of an early painting by Kandinsky), The Blue Rider was formed in Munich mainly around Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc. Its members began to reject representational art and move towards abstraction, as they saw abstraction as a means of conceiving the natural world in terms that could surpass representation; according to Kandinsky’s influential essay Concerning the Spiritual in Art, blue is the color of spirituality, and the darker the blue, the more it awakens the human desire for the eternal. In addition to Kandinsky (The Rider, Composition VI, Improvisation 28, The Cow) and Marc (Large Blue Horses, Fighting Forms, Animals in Landscape), other members of The Blue Rider include Alexej von Jawlensky (Variation), Marianne von Werefkin, August Macke (View into a Lane), and Gabriele Munter (Dorfstrasse in Blau).\n\nThe Bridge (Die Brücke) (1905) Founded by Ernst Kirchner in Dresden, Die Brücke is so named because members of the movement saw themselves as the bridge between traditional and modern painting. Inspired by Fauvism, members of The Bridge followed similar ideals, utilizing violent juxtapositions of color; however, paintings of The Bridge were noticeably more intense, reflecting emotional agitation through scenes of city streets and sexually charged events in country settings.

Influenced by the simple geometries of African masks, Picasso’s Cubism sought to allow an object to be viewed from many sides at once by breaking down the figures into angles and shapes. Cubism as a whole can be subdivided into three movements: analytical cubism (1907–1912), synthetic cubism (1912–c. 1930), and curvilinear cubism (1930s). Analytical cubism was highly experimental, showing jagged edges and sharp multifaceted lines, such as in Picasso’s Girl With a Mandolin. Synthetic cubism was inspired by collages and featured flattened forms of normal objects, such as in Picasso’s Mandolin and Guitar. Curvilinear cubism contrasted with the flattened and firm edges of synthetic by featuring more flowing, rounded lines, such as in Georges Braque’s Houses at l’Estaque. Besides the aforementioned pioneers of cubism, Picasso (whose other Cubist works include Guernica and The Poet) and Braque (Pitcher and Violin, Viaduct at l’Estaque, Still Life with Metronome), other prominent Cubists include Juan Gris (Portrait of Picasso, Guitar and Pipe), Jean Metzinger (Deux Nus, Tea Time), Robert Delaunay (Simultaneous Windows on the City, La Ville de Paris), Albert Gleizes (The Bathers, Portrait de Jacques Nayral), Fernand Leger (Still Life with a Beer Mug), and Henri Le Fauconnier (L’Abondance).\n\nFuturism (1909–1914) Inspired by the scientific and technological advances of the start of the 20th century, a group of Italian artists came together to form the Futurist movement in 1909, seeking to represent the glory of machines and speed in their art; in his “The Futurist Manifesto”, Filippo Marinetti declared that “a roaring motor car which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.” The Futurists used a cubist-inspired approach to represent figures in multiple states at once, thus giving their works an animated yet shattered feel. Notable Futurists include Umberto Boccioni (Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, Development of a Bottle in Space, The City Rises, Dynamism of a Cyclist), Giacomo Balla (Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash, Abstract Speed + Sound), Carlo Carra (Funeral of the Anarchist Galli), and Gino Severini (Armored Train in Action, Dynamic Hieroglyphic of the Bal Tabarin). Although Marcel Duchamp is not usually associated with Futurism, his Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 (which caused an uproar at the Armory Show in 1913) displays many characteristics of Futurist painting.\n\nMetaphysical painting (1910–1920s) Influenced by the work of late 19th-century German philosophers, metaphysical painters sought to create enigmatic scenes which beckoned viewers to interpret a meaning based on symbols, suggestions, and impressions, thus foreshadowing the Surrealist paintings of the following decades. In many metaphysical paintings, human figures are represented by shadows or lifeless dummies and are placed in mysterious settings of seemingly infinite space, giving the canvasses dreamlike, eerie, and vaguely threatening qualities. Additionally, the paintings were given intentionally enigmatic titles to contribute to their cryptic effect. Metaphysical painting was based on the works of Italian artists Giorgio de Chirico (The Disquieting Muses, The Song of Love, Melancholy and Mystery of a Street, Le Reve Transforme), Giorgio’s brother Alberto Savinio, and former Futurist Carlo Carra (The Oval of Apparition). The metaphysical painting movement came to an end in the 1920s after an argument between de Chirico and Carra over who had founded the group.\n\nSuprematism (1913–1920s) Immediately prior to the Russian Revolution, a group of Russian artists formed the independent suprematist movement, so named because they believed that non-objective reality was greater than anything that could be achieved by representation; in his “The Non-Objective World: The Manifesto of Suprematism”, suprematist founder Kazimir Malevich stated “By ‘Suprematism’ I mean the supremacy of pure feeling in creative art. To the suprematist the visual phenomena of the objective world are, in themselves, meaningless; the significant thing is feeling.” Suprematist works often consist of simple geometric shapes of limited color placed at diagonals or some thoughtful arrangement on a white background. Major works by Kazimir Malevich in the suprematist style include Suprematist Composition: Airplane Flying, Black Square, Black Circle, Suprematist Composition: White on White, and Suprematism. After the communists took control of Russia, suprematism died out, much like many other abstract art movements under totalitarian governments.\n\nDada (1916–1925) Deriving its name from a nonsense word that literally means “hobby horse” (supposedly chosen by stabbing a knife into a dictionary), Dada was an anti-art movement in Zurich, Cologne, Berlin, Paris, and New York that rejected artistic and social norms in order to protest the establishment. Fervently opposed to the useless slaughter of World War I, Dadaists rejected conventional methods of representation and exhibition: they abandoned oil and canvas, often did work on glass, and accepted “readymades” (commonplace objects selected and exhibited as works of art) as valid art forms. Dada works often relied on location or accident, such as if a glass should shatter, the artist would hail the accident as an enhancement or an achievement brought about by chance; much like many other abstract artists, Dadaists favored artistic concept over execution. The foremost proponent of Dada was Marcel Duchamp, whose readymades include Fountain, L.H.O.O.Q., In Advance of the Broken Arm, and Bicycle Wheel, in addition to the aforementioned non-Dada painting Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2. Duchamp’s piece The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass), consists of two panes of glass with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust, and utilizes chance procedures; when the glass broke in a shipping crate and received a large crack, Duchamp left the cracks intact, incorporating the “accident” into the piece. Other key Dada artists include Jean Arp (Cloud Shepherd, Shirt Front and Fork), Man Ray (Lampshade, Le Violon d’Ingres), Raoul Hausmann (Mechanical Head (The Spirit of Our Time), Kp’erioum, ABCD (Self-portrait)), Hannah Hoch (Cut with the Kitchen Knife through the Beer-Belly of the Weimar Republic), Francis Picabia, and Hans Richter.\n\nDe Stijl (1917–1920s) Also known as neoplasticism, De Stijl (Dutch for “The Style”) was founded in Amsterdam in 1917 and sought to create paintings that were completely abstract, with no references to nature whatsoever. De Stijl paintings are typically set on a white background, use black lines to shape rectangular spaces, use only black and the three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue), contain no modulation, and use only perpendicular lines (diagonals are forbidden). While the movement’s theories were outlined by Theo van Doesburg (Neo-Plasticism: Composition VII (the three graces), Composition decentralisee, Composition in Gray (Rag-Time)), the principal practitioner of De Stijl was Piet Mondrian (Broadway Boogie Woogie, Victory Boogie Woogie, Tableau I, Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow, Lozenge Composition with Red, Black, Blue, and Yellow); other De Stijl painters include Vilmos Huszar and Bart van der Leck. De Stijl also manifested itself in the architectural works of Gerrit Rietvald (Schroder House, Red Blue Chair), Robert van’t Hoff (Villa Henny), and J. J. P. Oud (Gallery house at Weissenhof Estate).\n\nSurrealism (1924–1930s) According to André Breton’s “Surrealist Manifesto,” Surrealism is “pure psychic automatism, by which one proposes to express, either verbally, in writing, or by any other manner, the real functioning of thought”; inspired by the work of psychologists Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, Surrealists sought to represent an unseen world of dreams, subconscious thoughts, and unspoken communication. Similar to metaphysical painting and Dada, Surrealist works are not meant to be clearly understood — they are meant to puzzle, challenge, and fascinate by means of confusing titles, unusual arrangements of reality-based subjects, and abounding contradictions. Painters associated with the Surrealist movement include Salvador Dalí (The Persistence of Memory, Swans Reflecting Elephants, Metamorphosis of Narcissus), Joan Miró (Dog Barking at the Moon, The Tilled Field, Harlequin’s Carnival), René Magritte (Time Transfixed, The Treachery of Images, The Son of Man), former Dadaist Max Ernst (Two Children Are Threatened by a Nightingale, The Elephant Celebes), Frida Kahlo (Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird, The Two Fridas, The Little Deer), former metaphysical painter Giorgio de Chirico (whose stark color contrasts and veristic style strongly influenced surrealist painting), and Yves Tanguy. Surrealist sculptors included Alexander Calder (Lobster Trap and Fish Tail, Flamingo), Meret Oppenheim (Object), and Alberto Giacometti (Woman with Her Throat Cut, L’Homme qui marche I). The Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel created a number of films in the surrealist style, collaborating with Dalí on Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog) — which Roger Ebert called the “most famous short film ever made” — and L’Age d’Or (The Golden Age).\n\nDepression-era art (1930s) From 1929 to 1939, art in America reflected and embodied the despair associated with the Great Depression, often raising social issues and concerns of the public. American artists of the decade rejected European abstract art in favor of realism and raw human emotion in order to emphasize the true plight of the destitute. The photographer Dorothea Lange made the desperation of the Depression visible to the general public via documentary photography, such as with her works Migrant Mother, White Angel Breadline, and Ditched, Stalled and Stranded; later, Lange would document the struggle of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Painters such as Aaron Douglas and Jacob Lawrence developed the visual art aspect of the Harlem Renaissance (a period of rebirth and freedom of expression for African-Americans in the early 20th century), highlighting African-American life — such as in Douglas’ Aspects of Negro Life series — and exposing social injustices committed towards Blacks — such as in Lawrence’s 60-panel Migration series. Edward Hopper depicted somber and realistic scenes of city life, such as with his paintings Nighthawks, Chop Suey, Automat, and Early Sunday Morning. Similarly, Grant Wood explored country life — especially Midwestern subjects in rural Iowa — in such works as American Gothic, Daughters of Revolution, Parson Weems’ Fable, The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, Appraisal, and The Birthplace of Herbert Hoover, West Branch, Iowa."

    "title": "Schools Of Western Philosophy",
    "content": "Stoicism is an ancient Greek school that idealized freedom from emotions. It was founded by Zeno of Citium, who taught at the “painted porch” in Athens. (The name of the movement derives from the Greek word “stoa,” which means “porch.”) An important Stoic idea was that of the “pneuma,” or the “breath of life,” which is the life force that structures matter and the soul. Important thinkers include Epictetus, a slave whose views were recorded by his student Arrian in the Discourses, and the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius.\n\nSkepticism encourages the rejection of truths unless they are supported by sufficient evidence. Academic Skepticism, which states that no truths can be certain, was led by such men as Arcesilaus and Carneades. Another form of skepticism is known as “Pyrrhonian,” after Pyrrho of Elis, who is considered the founder of skepticism. The thinker Sextus Empiricus, who lived in the second century AD, provided one of the most complete accounts of skepticism in his Outlines of Pyrrhonism.\n\nScholasticism was taught at medieval Christian universities and sought to reconcile Christian thought with classical thinkers such as Aristotle. This school included Thomas Aquinas, who provided five arguments for the existence of God (called the “quinque viae”) in his Summa Theologica. Other thinkers include Pierre Abelard (who wrote Sic et Non) and Peter Lombard (who wrote The Four Books of Sentences).\n\nEmpiricism is the view that all knowledge derives from sensory experience. John Locke, whose works include An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, thought that the mind starts out as a tabula rasa — (blank slate) and that we gain knowledge through experiences. Other empiricist philosophers include George Berkeley (who wrote A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge) and David Hume (who wrote An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding).\n\nRationalism, which is often contrasted with empiricism, asserts that we gain knowledge through intuition or our rational nature rather than through experience. A version of this doctrine was espoused by the Greek philosopher Plato in his Theory of Forms, which states that abstract ideas (“forms”) are more real than the material world of the senses. Later rationalists include René Descartes (who wrote Meditations on First Philosophy) and Baruch Spinoza (who wrote Ethics).\n\nPositivism encourages the use of the scientific method to discover the laws that govern society. It was founded by the 19th-century Frenchman Auguste Comte, who believed that society develops through three stages, which he termed the theocratic, metaphysical, and positive. It should not be confused with logical positivism, a 20th-century movement whose leaders included the young Ludwig Wittgenstein (who wrote Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus) and which holds that the only meaningful statements are those that are logically verifiable.\n\nPragmatism is a movement that values ideas based on their practical application (what is sometimes known as the “cash value” of an idea). Its prominent thinkers include William James (who wrote Pragmatism) and John Dewey (who wrote Democracy and Education). The founder of pragmatism was James’s friend C. S. Peirce, who expounded its ideas in such essays as “The Fixation of Belief” and “How to Make Our Ideas Clear.”\n\nUtilitarianism is a school of ethics that advocates the maximization of “utility,” which is often identified with pleasure or happiness. Its most influential early thinker was Jeremy Bentham, who asserted that it is the “greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong.” The foremost utilitarian was Bentham’s disciple, John Stuart Mill, who expounded his views in such books as Utilitarianism and On Liberty.\n\nExistentialism is a loosely defined movement of 19th- and 20th-century thinkers who focused on the importance of leading an “authentic” life. Many thinkers that are now thought of as “existentialists” would either not have recognized the term, as it emerged after their time, or would not have accepted it as a description of their outlook. The movement is often identified with the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, who asserted that “existentialism is a humanism.” Others associated with the movement include the 19th-century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (who wrote Either/Or), the 20th-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger (who wrote Being and Time), and Sartre’s contemporary Albert Camus (who wrote The Myth of Sisyphus)."

    "content": "Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775): The first battles of the American Revolutionary War were skirmishes near Boston in the two towns of Lexington and Concord, as well as Cambridge, Lincoln and Menotomy. British regulars under Francis Smith attempted to destroy the supplies of the colonial militia, but were stopped by Minutemen. Ralph Waldo Emerson described the first shot as the “shot heard round the world.”\n\nTiconderoga (May 10, 1775): A small but symbolic victory for the American forces led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. The Green Mountain Boys captured Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain from the British and transported its cannons to Boston.\n\nBunker Hill (June 17, 1775): This British pyrrhic victory outside Boston resulted in the capture of the Charlestown Peninsula, but showed that colonial troops could stand up to British regulars. Most of the fighting actually occurred on Breed’s Hill, not Bunker Hill.\n\nQuebec (December 31, 1775): The culmination of a failed invasion of Canada by American colonists. In a blinding snowstorm, the American general Richard Montgomery was killed in battle, Benedict Arnold was wounded, and Daniel Morgan was captured.\n\nLong Island (August 27, 1776): The largest battle of the entire war, Long Island (or Brooklyn Heights) resulted in the British capture of New York. William Howe defeated George Washington.\n\nTrenton (December 26, 1776): Occurred early in the morning after George Washington’s crossing of the Delaware River on Christmas night. The Hessians, under the command of Johann Rall, were surprised and about two-thirds of them were captured.\n\nGermantown (October 4, 1777): Washington’s attack on Germantown was the Continental Army’s last major effort to retake Philadelphia before the winter of 1777–1778. After this defeat, Washington’s troops wintered at Valley Forge.\n\nSaratoga (ended October 17, 1777): The major turning point of the American Revolution because the American victory led France to join the war. British General John Burgoyne led an invasion into New York from Canada with hopes of meeting another British army and splitting the American colonies. The final surrender was preceded by battles at Freeman’s Farm and Bemis Heights. Horatio Gates led the American forces.\n\nMonmouth (June 28, 1778): The last major battle of the Northern theater of the war; its outcome was inconclusive. American general Charles Lee was court-martialed for his actions at Monmouth. Molly Pitcher became famous for fighting in this battle in place of her husband.\n\nCamden (August 16, 1780): The American defeat was part of the British “southern strategy,” which included the earlier capture of Charleston and Savannah. Charles Cornwallis inflicted a humiliating defeat on the forces of Horatio Gates.\n\nCowpens (January 17, 1781): A turning point in the American recapture of South Carolina. Daniel Morgan commanded the Continentals and Banastre Tarleton led the British. The battle was fought between the Pacolet and Broad Rivers.\n\nYorktown (ended October 19, 1781): The Siege of Yorktown essentially ended the American Revolutionary War, although the Treaty of Paris wasn’t signed until two years later. George Washington, with help from the French navy under the Comte de Grasse, surrounded the forces of Cornwallis and forced the British to surrender. General Charles O’Hara presented Cornwallis’s sword of surrender."

    "content": "Simón Bolívar was a Venezuelan who is known as “El Libertador” for freeing much of South America from Spanish rule. He authored the Cartagena Manifesto and Decree of War to the Death in his quest to liberate Colombia and Venezuela, during which he won the Battle of Carabobo. After gaining independence from Spain, he led the short-lived republic of Gran Colombia, which from 1819 to 1830 included modern Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama.\n\nJosé de San Martín was an Argentine general who liberated Argentina and Chile from Spain with Bernardo O’Higgins. San Martín won the Battle of San Lorenzo in 1813. Later, his crossing of the Andes resulted in victories at the Battles of Chacabuco and Maipu in Chile. San Martín took part in the liberation of Peru before moving to Europe in 1824.\n\nBernardo O’Higgins, a leader of Chilean independence, was the illegitimate son of an Irish-Spanish officer and a Chilean mother. His early attempt at rebellion against the Spanish crown ended in defeat at Rancagua in 1813, after which he went into exile in Argentina. O’Higgins returned to Chile with San Martín in 1817, and served as that country’s Supreme Director until 1823.\n\nPedro I was the Emperor of Brazil from 1822 to 1831. The son of King John VI of Portugal, Pedro became the first ruler of the Empire of Brazil when he declared independence from Portugal in 1822 with the Cry of Ipiranga. In 1831, he abdicated in favor of his son in order to launch an ill-fated invasion of Portugal.\n\nPedro II was the Emperor of Brazil from 1831 to 1889. Pedro II became emperor at age 5 when his father abdicated. During Pedro II’s reign, Brazil was victorious in several conflicts with its neighbors, including the Platine War and War of the Triple Alliance.\n\nAlfredo Stroessner was the dictator of Paraguay from 1954 to 1989. Stroessner ruled Paraguay with an iron fist, and was backed by the CIA for his anti-communist purges. He came to power by overthrowing Federico Chávez in 1954 and assuming leadership of his Colorado Party.\n\nSalvador Allende was the President of Chile from 1970 to 1973. Allende was the first Marxist head of state to be democratically elected in Latin America. His policies of collectivization and nationalization angered conservatives, and Allende was overthrown and killed in a 1973 coup supported by the CIA. Allende had survived a coup called El Tanquetazo earlier in 1973.\n\nAugusto Pinochet was the dictator of Chile from 1973 to 1990. Salvador Allende was overthrown on September 11, 1973 by Pinochet. His economic policies were informed by the Chicago Boys, Chilean economists who had studied under Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago, and mostly relied on privatizing the economy. Pinochet’s brutal regime was investigated in the Rettig and Valech reports, and he died awaiting trial in 2006.\n\nJuan Perón was the president of Argentina from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974. Juan Perón became widely admired after his 1945 marriage to actress Eva Duarte, who was immortalized in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Evita. The backbone of his political support were working-class people known as descamisados, meaning “shirtless ones”. His policies came to be called Perónism, represented by the three flags of economic independence, political sovereignty and social justice, which represented a Third Way between capitalism and communism. Upon Juan Perón’s death in 1974, he was succeeded as President by his third wife, Isabel.\n\nHugo Chávez was the President of Venezuela from 1999 to 2013. Chávez used Venezuela’s large oil revenues to lead his Bolivarian Revolution and enact socialist policies. His original party was the Fifth Republic Movement. Chávez’s had been imprisoned after a failed coup attempt in 1992. He died of cancer in 2013."

    "content": "Sumer was one of the first civilizations to arise in Mesopotamia. Sumer was a collection of city-states including Eridu, Uruk, and Ur. This civilization created cuneiform, the first known writing system, which was made by putting wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets.\n\nThe Akkadian Empire was the first empire in the world, and consisted of Sumerians and Akkadian-speaking Semites. The empire was founded by Sargon the Great, who conquered all of Mesopotamia in the 24th and 23rd centuries BC.\n\nAssyria was a region located along the Upper Tigris River in what is now northern Iraq. Its major cities included Aššur and Nineveh. Assyria was ruled at various times by the Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian and Babylonian empires. In 911 BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was founded by Ashur-Dan II; it lasted until 612 BC. Some of the empire’s greatest rulers were Tiglath-Pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib, and Ashurbanipal. At its height, the Neo-Assyrian Empire ruled over all of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Levant (the eastern shore of the Mediterranean).\n\nBabylonia was a region of lower Mesopotamia centered on the city Babylon. The different incarnations of Babylonian empires included the Amorite, Kassite, and Chaldean dynasties. The most notable Amorite ruler was Hammurabi, famed for his legal code, though Babylon was at its most powerful under the Chaldeans. The Chaldean ruler Nebuchadnezzar II built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and destroyed Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Hittites created a large empire in the late Bronze Age centered on their capital, Hattusa, in Anatolia (the western portion of what is now Turkey). Their empire engaged in the first widespread use of iron and chariots in war. The Hittites, under King Muwatalli II, were defeated by the Egyptians under Ramesses II at the Battle of Kadesh, which involved as many as 5000 chariots. The Hittite Empire came to an end less than a century later as part of the Bronze Age collapse.\n\nThe Bronze-Age Minoan civilization was centered on the Greek island Crete and included nearby islands. The British archaeologist Arthur Evans unearthed much of what we know about the Minoans, including their palace at Knossos and their writing system, which he called Linear A.\n\nThe Mycenaeans succeeded the Minoans as the preeminent Greek civilization. Much of their territory was on the Greek mainland, including the city of Mycenae itself. Their writing system is called Linear B. The Mycenaeans disappeared in the late Bronze Age collapse. Homer’s Iliad is set during the Mycenaean period, and Agamemnon is said to have been the King of Mycenae.\n\nLydia was an Iron-Age kingdom that encompassed most of western Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) and had its capital at Sardis. Lydians are credited with inventing coins, and their last king, Croesus, was famous for being fabulously wealthy. When Croesus asked the Oracle at Delphi about his war plans, Croesus was told that if he attacked the Persians, he would destroy a great empire. This came true as Cyrus the Great defeated Croesus and sacked Sardis.\n\nThe Achaemenid Empire or first Persian Empire was founded by Cyrus the Great, who defeated and incorporated the Babylonian Empire, Lydian Empire and Median Empire. Based in what is now Iran, the empire had its ceremonial capital at Persepolis. Under kings Darius and Xerxes, Persia unsuccessfully invaded Greece. The First Persian Empire came to an end when Darius III was defeated by Alexander the Great.\n\nThe Parthian Empire was the second major empire to come out of Persia. The Parthian Empire was founded by Arsaces I, who rebelled against the Seleucid Empire. Parthians often fought with Rome, and at the 53 BC Battle of Carrhae, the Roman general Crassus was killed. The Parthian Empire was supplanted by the Sassanian Empire in AD 224."

    "title": "Ballets",
    "content": "Appalachian Spring (1944) by Aaron Copland. Copland had several working names for Appalachian Spring while composing it, including House of Victory and Ballet for Martha. The latter name refers to its choreographer, Martha Graham, who took its ultimate title from a line in Hart Crane’s poem “The Bridge.” Graham’s ballet depicts a group of pioneers in Pennsylvania — including a newlywed couple — building a farmhouse and encountering a Revivalist preacher and his flock. The ballet’s original set was designed by Graham’s frequent collaborator Isamu Noguchi. Because Appalachian Spring was first performed in the Library of Congress, Copland was forced to limit the accompanying ensemble to just thirteen musicians. The best-known section of the ballet by far is Copland’s use of the traditional Shaker hymn “Simple Gifts” in the penultimate section of the suite; the full ballet contains several more movements based on variations on the hymn.\n\nBilly the Kid (1938) by Aaron Copland. Choreographed by Eugene Loring, this ballet depicts episodes in the life of the title Old West outlaw. Early in the ballet, Billy’s mother is accidentally killed in a gunfight; Billy then stabs the man who killed her. Sections from the ballet include “Card Game at Night” and a “Gun Battle” that features percussion imitating the title shootout. At the end of the ballet, when Billy is resting in the desert, a posse led by Pat Garrett finds and kills him. The story of Billy’s life is bookended at the beginning and end by a section called “The Open Prairie,” which depicts settlers moving west. The ballet makes extensive use of cowboy songs, such as “The Old Chisholm Trail” and “Goodbye Old Paint” in its depiction of a frontier town, and features a “Jarabe,” a Mexican dance in 5/8 time.\n\nThe Creation of the World (La Création du Monde) (1923) by Darius Milhaud. A trip to the U.S. inspired Milhaud to write The Creation of the World in 1922. Enchanted by the jazz bands Milhaud heard in Harlem, the ballet shows a heavy influence of jazz and blues, as well as traditional African rhythms; Milhaud omitted violas, substituting an alto saxophone. Choreographed by Jean Börlin and using a set designed by Cubist artist Ferdinand Leger, the ballet aims to depict the beginning of creation according to African tradition: the creator gods Mzame, Mbere, and Nkwa appear out of a seemingly empty void to create animals, plants, and then the first man and woman. The latter then perform a routine based on popular Dixieland dances and conclude the ballet in the tableau “The Man and the Woman Kiss.”\n\nThe Creatures of Prometheus (Die Geschöpfe des Prometheus) (1801) by Ludwig van Beethoven. Choreographer Salvatore Viganò asked Beethoven to write the music for The Creatures of Prometheus. In the ballet, two statues come to life; Prometheus then takes them to Parnassus and exposes them to “the passions of human existence.” They learn music from Orpheus, tragedy and comedy from the Muses, and dance from Pan and Bacchus. The ballet’s overture, like Beethoven’s First Symphony, begins with dissonant chords giving way into a lilting melody. Its finale contains a theme Beethoven would use in his “Eroica” Symphony (No. 3) and his Op. 35, the Eroica Variations for piano.\n\nDaphnis and Chloe (Daphnis et Chloé) (1912) by Maurice Ravel. Commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev and choreographed by Michel Fokine, Daphnis and Chloe is based on the only surviving work by the Greek author Longus. The ballet starts in a sacred grotto, where Daphnis, Chloe, and other youths arrive to give an offering to three statues of the Nymphs. When the cowherd Dorcon challenges Daphnis to a dance contest for a kiss from Chloe, Dorcon is humiliated. A group of pirates abduct Chloe and take her to their island, where she is forced to dance for their leader, Bryaxis. The god Pan saves Chloe; after reuniting her with Daphnis, Pan is reminded of his own love for the nymph Syrinx. Daphnis and Chloe then reenact Pan’s courtship of Syrinx. The rest of the company joins in a bacchanalian “Danse générale” featuring a wordless chorus. Ravel reworked the music from Daphnis and Chloe into two suites often performed in the concert hall.\n\nFancy Free (1944) by Leonard Bernstein. Fancy Free, the first ballet choreographed by American dancer Jerome Robbins, was inspired by Paul Cadmus’s painting The Fleet’s In!. The ballet depicts the antics of three sailors on shore leave in New York City, where they meet two beautiful women. To determine which one will leave dateless, the sailors hold a dance contest, performing a galop, waltz, and a Cuban danzón. However, the women cannot choose a winner, and the sailors quickly start fighting. The women run away, but the men reconcile and the ballet ends with them crossing paths with another attractive woman and starting to pursue her. Fancy Free’s success catapulted both Bernstein and Robbins to stardom; Bernstein later adapted Fancy Free into a musical and a film under the title On the Town; the musical features the song “New York, New York.”\n\nThe Firebird (L’Oiseau de feu or Zhar-ptitsa) (1910) by Igor Stravinsky. Choreographed by Michel Fokine, The Firebird was the first of several collaborations between Stravinsky and Ballets Russes director Sergei Diaghilev. Prince Ivan, the ballet’s protagonist, captures the mythical Firebird, who pledges a feather to Ivan in exchange for her freedom. Ivan later stumbles upon thirteen princesses performing the “Dance of the Golden Apples.” Ivan follows them back to the castle of Kashchei the Immortal, who has enchanted and imprisoned them. Kashchei, whose magic is represented by a recurring descending chromatic motif, sends bewitched monsters to attack Ivan. Ivan uses the feather to summon the Firebird, who uses her magic to make the monsters perform an “Infernal Dance” before lulling them to sleep with a “Berceuse.” While the monsters sleep, Ivan discovers the egg that preserves Kashchei’s power inside a tree trunk and destroys it, breaking Kashchei’s spell. Ivan frees the princesses, marrying one of them in the ballet’s 7/4-time finale. Stravinsky created three versions of the ballet suite for a smaller orchestra, which were published in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\nGiselle (1841) by Adolphe Adam. Choreographed by Jean Coralli and Jules Perot, Adam wrote Giselle for Perot’s lover, Carlotta Grisi, who danced the title role at its premiere. Giselle, a peasant girl, falls in love with Loys, who is secretly Duke Albrecht of Silesia in disguise. Although Albrecht is engaged to Princess Bathilde, he pursues his romance with Giselle. After playing “he loves me, he loves me not” with a daisy, Giselle is shocked when the gamekeeper Hilarion, who also loves her, presents Albrecht’s sword, revealing Albrecht’s noble status. Unable to handle Albrecht’s deception and knowing he can never marry her, Giselle goes mad, tearing the necklace her mother has given her, and dies of a broken heart. After her death, Giselle’s spirit is enlisted into the Wilis, a group of spirits led by Queen Myrtha. The Wilis corner Hilarion and force him to dance to death; but Giselle stops them from doing the same to Albrecht. Sparing Albrecht, the Wilis let Giselle’s ghost return to rest in her grave.\n\nThe Miraculous Mandarin (A csodálatos mandarin) (1926) by Belá Bartók. Based on a story by Melchior Lengyel, The Miraculous Mandarin opens by depicting a large city, with rapid ascending and descending notes on the strings followed by a theme of minor seconds and a brass imitation of car horns. In the ballet, a group of robbers force a girl to dance at the window of their apartment as a “Lockspiel,” or decoy, to lure in potential victims. After the criminals successfully rob an old lecher and a poor young man, the girl lures a rich Chinese man — the Mandarin — into the apartment; glissandos in the brass mark his entrance. After the Mandarin tries unsuccessfully to capture the girl, the tramps jump on him — symbolized by the repetition of the minor second intervals heard at the beginning of the ballet—and stab him three times, then hang him from a lamp. However, the Mandarin’s body begins to glow strangely. The girl then convinces the robbers to free the man, whom she then embraces, allowing him to die peacefully. The material of the ballet made it controversial upon its 1926 premiere; the mayor of Cologne, where the ballet debuted, had it banned on moral grounds.\n\nThe Nutcracker (Shchelkunchik) (1892) by Peter Tchaikovsky. Now a Christmastime favorite, The Nutcracker was choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. The plot, based on an E. T. A. Hoffmann story, opens at a Christmas party, where Drosselmeyer gives his goddaughter Clara a toy nutcracker, which her brother Fritz soon breaks. At night, the living room becomes a battleground between the evil Mouse King and toys and gingerbread soldiers, led by the Nutcracker. Clara throws her slipper at the Mouse King, distracting him long enough for the Nutcracker to kill him. The Nutcracker then turns into a prince and leads Clara into a magical forest where the “Waltz of the Snowflakes” marks the end of Act I. In Act II Clara and the prince arrive in the Land of Sweets, where they witness dances representing delicacies from around the world, including Arabian coffee and Spanish chocolate, as well as the “Dance of the Reed Flutes” and the Russian “Trepak.” Mother Ginger has a group of clowns (“Polcinelles”) emerge from her skirt to dance before the orchestra plays the “Waltz of the Flowers” and the Sugar Plum Fairy and the Cavalier dance a pas de deux. Finally, the Sugar Plum Fairy dances alone to music that marks one of the first orchestral uses of the celesta."

    "title": "Popes",
    "content": "Peter (c. 1 – c. 68, pope c. 30 – c. 68) was, in Catholic belief, the first Bishop of Rome and thus the first pope. Peter was the leader of the twelve apostles; Jesus changed his name from Simon to Peter and declared him the “rock [on which] I will build my church.” Jesus also bestowed upon him the keys to the kingdom of Heaven and the power to “bind” and “loose” in Heaven and on Earth. He was crucified upside-down by Emperor Nero and is the namesake of St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City.\n\nGregory I or Gregory the Great (c. 540–604, pope 590–604) was one of the “Latin Fathers” of the church and is considered the founder of the medieval papacy. After remarking that some English boys at a slave market were “not Angles, but angels,” he sent Augustine of Canterbury on a mission to Christianize southern Britain. His writings include a Commentary on Job and Pastoral Care, and he is known as the Dialogist in Eastern traditions. He is credited with introducing Gregorian chant, named in his honor, into the Catholic rite.\n\nUrban II (c. 1035–1099, pope 1088–1099) ordered the First Crusade. Ambassadors from Byzantine emperor Alexius Komnenos came to the 1095 Council of Piacenza requesting help in reclaiming the Holy Land from the Seljuk Turks. Urban II responded by calling the Council of Clermont, where he urged a crusade with the phrase “Deus Vult,” or “God wills it.” The subsequent First Crusade lasted from 1096 to 1099.\n\nInnocent III (c. 1160–1216, pope 1198–1216) ordered the disastrous Fourth Crusade and excommunicated Venetian crusaders who changed course from Jerusalem to sack Constantinople. He also initiated the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars of southern France. Innocent III convened the Fourth Lateran Council, which defined the dogma of transubstantiation and required Muslims and Jews to wear identifying clothing. In 1209, he excommunicated King John for refusing to recognize the appointment of Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nAlexander VI (1431–1503, pope 1492–1503) was a prominent member of the Borgia family and the father of Cesare and Lucrezia. He excommunicated the Florentine friar Savonarola in 1498. With his son Cesare, he was accused of inviting prostitutes into the Papal Palace to host the scandalous “Banquet of the Chestnuts.” In international affairs, Alexander VI assigned New World territory to Spain in the bull Inter Caetera, which became the basis for the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nJulius II (1443–1513; pope 1503–1513) was nicknamed the “Warrior Pope” for his military ambition in expanding the Papal States. He joined the League of Cambrai to resist Venetian expansion in northern Italy. He also instituted the Swiss Guard and commissioned Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Michelangelo created a number of notable sculptures as part of a plan for Julius II’s tomb, including the Rebellious Slave, Dying Slave, and a “Horned Moses” based on a mistranslation of the Vulgate.\n\nLeo X (1475–1521; pope 1513–1521) was a son of Lorenzo de Medici whose papacy included the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. He revived the unpopular sale of indulgences to fund the construction of St. Peter’s Basilica. Martin Luther responded by publishing his 95 Theses, which Leo denounced in the papal bull Exsurge Domine. At his coronation, Leo was given a white elephant named Hanno by Manuel I of Portugal; the animal was buried beneath the Vatican after its death.\n\nPius IX (1792–1878; pope 1846–1878) was the longest-reigning pope in history. He reigned during Italian unification and remained a “prisoner in the Vatican” after the capture of Rome led to the annexation of the Papal States. Afterward, he rejected a Law of Guarantees that sought to define the rights of the Church within the Kingdom of Italy. Pius defined the dogma of the Immaculate Conception in the decree Ineffabilis Deus and established papal infallibility at the First Vatican Council. He released a controversial list of 80 heresies in his Syllabus of Errors.\n\nJohn Paul II (1920–2005; pope 1978–2005) was from Poland, making him the first non-Italian pope in over 400 years. In 1981, he was shot by Mehmet Ali Agca, a member of the Turkish terrorist group Grey Wolves; he survived and forgave Agca while visiting him in prison. John Paul II defended the sanctity of life in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae and declared evolution to be compatible with Catholic theology. He denounced Marxist “liberation theology” in Latin America and may have inspired the Solidarity movement during a 1979 visit to his home country.\n\nFrancis (1936–present, pope 2013–present) served as the Archbishop of Buenos Aires before ascending to the papacy upon the resignation of Benedict XVI. He is the first Jesuit pope, the first pope from the Americas, and the first pope from outside of Europe since Gregory III in the 8th century. When asked in 2013 for his view on gay clergy members, he responded “Who am I to judge?”. He also had a historic meeting with Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church in Havana in 2016, and the two issued a joint declaration denouncing the persecution of Christians in the Middle East.\n\nGregory VII (c. 1025–1085, pope 1073–1085) excommunicated Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV during the Investiture Controversy. Henry sought absolution from the pope by walking barefoot through the snow to the village of Canossa.\n\nClement V (c. 1260–1314, pope 1305–1314) moved the seat of the papacy from Rome to the French city of Avignon, where it remained for 67 years in a period nicknamed the “Babylonian Captivity.”\n\nClement VII (1478–1534, pope 1523–1534) was pope during the 1527 Sack of Rome and refused to annul Henry VIII’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon. He is not to be confused with Antipope Clement VII, whose election in 1378 began the Western Schism.\n\nGregory XIII (1502–1585, pope 1572–1585) introduced the Gregorian Calendar in 1582 to correct the previous Julian Calendar.\n\nPius XII (1876–1958, pope 1939–1958) signed the Reichskonkordat with Nazi Germany in 1933, served as pope during World War II, and spoke infallibly to define the dogma of the Assumption of Mary.\n\nPope Emeritus Benedict XVI (1927–present, pope 2005–2013) resigned the papacy in 2013, becoming the first person to do so since the 15th century."

    "title": "Mountains",
    "content": "Mount Everest (China and Nepal): The border between Nepal and China straddles the summit of the Himalayan peak Mount Everest, which, at a height of over 29,000 feet, is the tallest mountain in the world. The Khumbu Icefall and the cliff-like Three Steps are hazards faced by potential climbers of Everest. It was first summited by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Local Sherpas act as guides for mountaineers in the area, though they walked out of the job over dangerous working conditions in 2014 after 16 of them were killed in an avalanche.\n\nK2 (Pakistan and China): Qogir, Ketu, and Mount Godwin-Austen are other names for K2, whose most common names come from the fact that it is the second-tallest mountain in the world. The “K” in K2 stands for Karakoram, the mountain range in Pakistan and China in which the peak is found. The House’s Chimney and the Black Pyramid are features of K2, which also possesses a different second-place record, behind the Annapurna Massif: it boasts the second-highest fatality rate among attempted climbers of any mountains above 8,000 meters.\n\nDenali (United States): Formerly and often called Mount McKinley, Denali is the highest mountain in North America. It is in south-central Alaska, in Denali National Park. The West Buttress route is considered the best path to ascend Denali. Frederick Cook, a man notorious for having faked the discovery of the North Pole, is now believed to have also faked his ascent of the mountain in 1906 as well, leaving a climbing party seven years later with the honor.\n\nMount Mitchell (United States): The Black Mountain subrange of the Appalachians is the location of Mount Mitchell, the tallest peak in the United States east of the Mississippi. This mountain, in North Carolina, was the subject of a debate over its altitude between its namesake and Thomas Clingman, leading Elisha Mitchell to attempt another ascent in which he fell to his death.\n\nThe Matterhorn (Switzerland and Italy): Edward Compton and John Ruskin are among the artists inspired by the Matterhorn, which is renowned for its almost perfectly pyramidal shape. The mountain is on the border between Switzerland and Italy, near the Swiss town Zermatt. It was first climbed in 1865 by Edward Whymper; four people died in that ascent.\n\nMount Kilimanjaro (Tanzania): Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira are the three summits of Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in Africa. It is notable for also being the tallest mountain that is not part of a mountain range, having been formed by a now-extinct volcano. A corpse of a leopard is found on top of the mountain in “The Snows of Kilimanjaro,” a short story by Ernest Hemingway that uses the mountain as the backdrop for the memories, and ultimately the death, of a writer suffering from gangrene.\n\nMount Kenya (Kenya): The second-tallest mountain in Africa is Mount Kenya, which shares its name with the country in which it is located. British geographer and political theorist Halford Mackinder led the first group to ascend the peak, which bypassed the Darwin Glacier and proceeded up the Diamond Glacier. Like Kilimanjaro, it was formed by a now-dormant volcano, and, like Kilimanjaro, part of its notoriety rests on a book. Facing Mount Kenya, an anthropological study of the Kikuyu people by Jomo Kenyatta, was one of the first such texts by an African ethnographer to gain fame.\n\nMount Kosciuszko (Australia): The name of Tadeusz Kosciuszko, the Polish commander who fought in the American Revolutionary War, was appended to the tallest mountain in Australia by European explorers in the 19th century. When it was discovered that Mount Townsend was actually taller, the names were switched so that Kosciuszko would remain the highest peak on the continent. The peak’s name in Aboriginal languages, such as Jagungal or Tackingal, translates to “table-top mountain.”\n\nMount Fuji (Japan): Yamanaka and Kawaguchi are two lakes found along the slopes of Mount Fuji, the tallest mountain in Japan. It is only about an hour’s drive from Tokyo, and has significance in the Shinto religion, being sacred to the goddess Sengen-Sama. The mountain was also depicted in the series of prints Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji, drawn by Hokusai.\n\nMount Aconcagua (Argentina): The subduction of the Nazca Plate formed Mount Aconcagua, the highest point in the Southern Hemisphere. It is near the city Mendoza in Argentina, and straddles the Polish Glacier, which provides a popular route for climbers looking to summit it."

The 2004 MMORPG (massively multiplayer online RPG) World of Warcraft, set in the same universe, has had over 10 million subscribers.\n\nPokémon: RPG series about animal-like “pocket monsters,” and the basis for the long-running Japanese animated series about trainer Ash Ketchum. Pokémon games are typically released in pairs that differ in which Pokémon are available, such as Red/Blue, Gold/Silver, X/Y, and 2016’s Sun/Moon. Notable Pokémon include Pikachu, Charizard, Lucario, Greninja, and Mewtwo. A mobile version, Pokémon Go, was released in 2016 to massive success.\n\nCall of Duty: First-person shooter (FPS) series published by Activision. The first three games centered on World War II, while more recent editions—starting with 2007’s Modern Warfare—have largely taken place in contemporary and near-future settings, and have courted controversy for such things as a level in which the player kills civilians while participating in a terrorist attack. The series is celebrated for its multiplayer modes, including cooperative Zombie modes.\n\nStarCraft: Another Blizzard RTS series, with a science fiction theme. The game features three playable races: Terrans (humans), Zerg (a single-minded collective of insect-like aliens), and Protoss (strong, humanoid aliens with psionic powers). StarCraft II, the series’s latest entry, was split into three parts whose stories each focused on one of the three races. Major characters in the series include Jim Raynor, a Terran leader, and Sarah Kerrigan, a former Terran psychic corrupted by the Zerg.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog: Flagship Sega franchise, starring a namesake blue hedgehog that runs at high speeds. Sonic first appeared on the Sega Genesis console in 1991, and is accompanied in later games by allies such as Tails (an orange, two-tailed fox) and Knuckles (a red echidna). The series’s villain is Dr. Eggman, known as Dr. Robotnik in the early Genesis games. Though the series has maintained popularity for over two decades, more recent games have had considerably less success than the first three Genesis games.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: An immensely successful Rockstar Games series that has repeatedly drawn criticism for its level of violence. Grand Theft Auto games are played in open world “sandboxes” that give the player the ability to do virtually anything they want. The series is set in satirized versions of real U.S. cities, with GTA III and GTA IV taking place in the New York knock-off Liberty City, GTA: Vice City taking place in a fictionalized Miami, and GTA: San Andreas and GTA V taking place in Los Santos, a send-up of Los Angeles.\n\nMadden NFL: The Madden series (which, prior to 1993, was simply known as John Madden Football due to licensing issues), has featured yearly installments since 1990 and is published by EA Sports (which also publishes the FIFA soccer series). Madden NFL traditionally features a different player on its box art each year; an apparent string of injuries to and poor seasons by players on the cover of that particular year’s game has become known as the Madden Curse."

    "title": "American Third Parties",
    "content": "The Anti-Masonic Party (established 1828) became America’s first third party by riding the tide of anti-Masonic sentiment following the 1826 disappearance of Freemason whistleblower William Morgan. For the 1832 election, the Anti-Masons selected William Wirt in the first presidential nominating convention in United States history. Running against eventual winner Andrew Jackson, a Democrat seeking re-election, and Henry Clay, a National Republican, Wirt managed to receive 8% of the popular vote and 7 electoral votes from Vermont. Vermont and Pennsylvania both elected Anti-Masons as governors, and Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont and other states all sent Anti-Masons to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe Free Soil Party (established 1848) was created through a union of anti-slavery factions from the two major parties, the Barnburner Democrats and Conscience Whigs. Its platform, unlike that of James G. Birney’s earlier Liberty Party (established 1840), did not aim to abolish slavery, but rather to cease its expansion. As a result, Free Soilers backed the Wilmot Proviso and opposed the Democratic Party on using popular sovereignty to decide slavery’s status. In its first year, 1848, the party ended up with two senators and 14 Representatives in Congress. Free Soil presidential candidate Martin van Buren managed to capture 10% of the popular vote, and his influence may have secured Whig candidate Zachary Taylor’s close victory over Democrat Lewis Cass.\n\nThe American Party (established 1843), better known as the Know-Nothing Party, formed from the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant nativism of early America. Secret societies like the Order of the Star Spangled Banner had been sprouting up since the 1840s, but the Know-Nothing Party was not a unified entity until the 1854 elections, when it won 52 of the 234 seats in the House, including the position of Speaker of the House. The 1856 presidential election was the first one for both the American Party behind Millard Fillmore and the Republican Party behind John C. Frémont. Fillmore received 22% of the popular vote but only eight electoral votes from Maryland; Frémont won eleven states with 33% of the popular vote. Strong Southern support, however, allowed Democrat James Buchanan an easy win.\n\nThe People’s Party (established 1891), better known as the Populist Party, had its roots in the same farmer-labor partnership that created the Greenback Party (established 1874). Opposed to the elites of the banking and railroad industries, the Populist movement promised agrarian and labor reform. Its first presidential candidate, James B. Weaver, captured 22 electoral votes from six western states with 8.5% of the vote in 1892, as Democrat Grover Cleveland won his rematch against Republican Benjamin Harrison. Also in the West, multiple Populist governors, senators, and representatives held power throughout the decade. The Populists nominated the same presidential candidate as the Democrats in 1896, William Jennings Bryan, because of his stance on a silver bi-metal currency, though the Populist vice-presidential candidate — party leader Thomas E. Watson — differed from the Democratic candidate. Bryan’s failure to defeat Republican William McKinley spelled the decline of the People’s Party.\n\nThe Socialist Party (established 1901) is usually associated with Eugene V. Debs, the face of the American socialist movement at its peak. He ran for president five times from 1900 to 1920, and managed to increase his vote counts with each successive campaign. He attracted over 900,000 votes twice: in 1912 with 6% of the vote, almost making it a four-way race, and in 1920, when Debs famously ran his campaign while imprisoned. Starting in 1928, his successor, Norman Thomas, ran for president six consecutive times, though the party was not quite able to replicate Debs’s success.\n\nThere were three notable iterations of the Progressive Party in the 20th century, each with its own ideology and goals. Former President Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Party (established 1912), better known as the Bull Moose Party, was created after he was unable to reclaim the Republican nomination from his former ally William Howard Taft. Roosevelt pitted his platform of New Nationalism, which promised reforms inspired by the Progressive movement, against Democrat Woodrow Wilson’s more conservative New Freedom. In the most successful American third-party campaign ever, Roosevelt’s 27% was still only enough to win six states; the split of the Republican voter base between him and Taft ensured a dominant victory for Wilson even though Wilson received only 42% of the vote. Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr.’s Progressive Party (established 1924) was created for him to run for president on his own brand of progressive ideals different from those of Roosevelt, his onetime rival. Running on promises resembling those of the earlier Populists, La Follette grabbed 17% of the vote in the 1924 election with thirteen electoral votes from his home state, Wisconsin. He came close to Democrat nominee John W. Davis in votes, but neither could prevent Republican Calvin Coolidge’s re-election. Former Vice President Henry Wallace’s Progressive Party (established 1948) formed out of Wallace’s disagreements with his replacement as FDR’s vice president, incumbent Harry S. Truman, who had fired Wallace from his position as Secretary of Commerce. In addition to promoting leftist reforms, Wallace also wanted cooperation with the Soviet Union, though his association with the Soviets and Communism hurt his popularity. In spite of this, he still won 2.4% of the vote with well over a million votes in a contentious election that Truman barely won over Thomas Dewey.\n\nFormer President Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Party (established 1912), better known as the Bull Moose Party, was created after he was unable to reclaim the Republican nomination from his former ally William Howard Taft. Roosevelt pitted his platform of New Nationalism, which promised reforms inspired by the Progressive movement, against Democrat Woodrow Wilson’s more conservative New Freedom. In the most successful American third-party campaign ever, Roosevelt’s 27% was still only enough to win six states; the split of the Republican voter base between him and Taft ensured a dominant victory for Wilson even though Wilson received only 42% of the vote.\n\nThe States’ Rights Democratic Party (established 1948), better known as the Dixiecrat Party, was founded by Southern Democrats to oppose President Truman’s re-election bid, in response to his actions advancing civil rights. When Truman was nominated by the Democrats in 1948, members from the South stormed out of the convention, creating a further divide within the party. With South Carolina governor Strom Thurmond as its candidate, the Dixiecrats — while receiving the same amount of votes as Henry Wallace — won 39 electoral votes from four southern states. Though it was a temporary split, the issue of civil rights did not disappear.\n\nThe Communist Party of the United States of America (established 1919) is notable mainly for attempts to outlaw it, such as the 1940 Smith Act which criminalized organizations advocating the violent overthrow of the government, the Communist Control Act of 1954, and the inquiries of the House Un-American Activities Committee and Senators Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy. Though the 1951 Supreme Court case Dennis v. U.S. ruled that there is no First-Amendment right to advocate the overthrow of the government, general concerns about freedom of speech and overreach in investigations of Communists put an end to prosecutions of individuals solely for belonging to the Communist Party by the early 1960s. The CPUSA ran Gus Hall for President four times, but was never a significant force at the ballot box. In 1995, a cache of Soviet documents known as VENONA was published, revealing that the CPUSA was controlled by Moscow. Like the Socialist Party, the CPUSA has splintered into several similarly named successor organizations.\n\nThe American Independent Party (established 1967) was a sort of spiritual successor to the Dixiecrats from two decades before. In an effort to combat the desegregation being pushed by a pro-civil rights federal government, George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama, ran for president on the ticket of the AIP, led by Bill and Eileen Shearer. Running on a platform of segregation once again proved appealing to the South, as Wallace won 46 electoral votes from five states, and 13% of the vote with nearly ten million votes. Many Wallace supporters, including the organizers of the AIP, later joined the U.S. Taxpayers Party, which was renamed the Constitution Party, and still exists as a small party to the right of the Republicans.\n\nThe Reform Party (established 1995) was created to follow up on Ross Perot’s 1992 independent campaign for President, in which he won 19% of the popular vote but no electoral votes, making him the most successful alternative candidate by vote count since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. Reform Party members agreed on the need for a balanced budget and changes to the electoral process, and were generally opposed to free trade agreements and immigration. The lack of a unified platform on other issues led to constant infighting over the party’s goals and an inability to capitalize on Perot’s initial success. Perot ran under the Reform banner again in the 1996 election, taking 8% of the vote. The Reform Party is perhaps best known for candidate Jesse Ventura’s surprise victory in the 1998 election for governor of Minnesota. In the 2000 election cycle, a conservative faction led by Pat Buchanan took over the party, leading to the departure of many Perot supporters and effectively ending the party. Ventura left the party midway through his governorship. Buchanan received several disputed votes under the Reform Party line on the infamous 2000 Florida “butterfly ballot.”\n\nThe Green Party (established 1991) never attracted as large of a share of the vote as the other third parties, but the ticket of Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke pulled 2.7% of the popular vote in the infamous 2000 presidential election, possibly influencing Republican George W. Bush’s extremely narrow victory over Democrat Al Gore, the winner of the popular vote. The Green Party continues to nominate candidates for presidential elections, and cites ecological sustainability, social justice, and fair democracy among its goals.\n\nIn New York, the state-based Liberal Party and Conservative Party act as ideological checks on Democrats and Republicans respectively, generally cross-endorsing their candidates when they are found acceptable, but occasionally running alternative candidates when they deem the mainstream parties’ nominees too moderate or compromising. James Buckley served a Senate term from 1971 to 1977 as a Conservative from New York after defeating both a Republican and Democrat in the 1970 election."

    "title": "Economic Concepts",
    "content": "Supply and Demand. Supply and demand embody the general idea that, at any given price, producers are willing to produce a given amount of a good (the quantity supplied) and consumers are willing to buy a different amount (the quantity demanded). As the price rises, firms will be willing to supply more goods, but fewer will be demanded; conversely, as price falls, consumers will demand more goods, but fewer will be supplied. On a graph showing price and quantity on its two axes, this is represented by a downward-sloping demand curve and an upward-sloping supply curve. Where the two curves intersect, there is an equilibrium; economists predict this equilibrium quantity will be produced (and consumed) in a free market.\n\nElasticity. Elasticity is a measure of how much one economic variable changes in response to a change in a different variable, expressed in the form of “Every 1% change in the independent (second) variable leads to an x% change in the value of the first (dependent) variable.” A common example is the price elasticity of demand, which measures the degree to which the quantity demanded changes when the price is altered.\n\nMonopoly. A monopoly occurs when there is only one firm producing goods for a given market. This allows that firm to set the price higher—and thus the quantity sold lower—than would otherwise occur. An oligopoly is a similar market environment where production is dominated by a few firms, whereas a monopsony is the opposite case: a market with only a single consumer.\n\nTariff. A tariff is a tax placed on the import (common) or export (rarer) of a good. Tariffs have various — often controversial — sociopolitical goals, but economists agree that they raise consumer prices relative to equilibrium (resulting in a lower quantity demanded). Tariffs are similar to quotas, in which a government limits the amount of a good that may be imported.\n\nFactors of production. There are three classical factors of production: land, labor, and capital (i.e., machinery and tools). Modern economists sometimes add a fourth, entrepreneurship.\n\nUnemployment. The unemployment rate refers to the percentage of the population that is actively seeking work but cannot find a job. Unemployment can be cyclical (common in seasonal industries like fieldwork), frictional (the natural time between jobs that exists in most labor markets), or structural (when workers’ skills do not match those required by open jobs).\n\nGross Domestic Product. Gross domestic product (or GDP), is a commonly used measure of the size of a country’s or state’s economy. GDP is computed by summing consumption, investment, government expenditures, and exports, and then subtracting imports.\n\nInflation. The inflation rate is the pace at which prices are rising, usually expressed in the form “2.5% per year.” This is equivalent to the rate at which currency loses its value. Inflation is often measured by the consumer price index, which establishes a standard basket of goods that a family might buy and seeing how its total price changes over a year.\n\nInterest rate. The interest rate is a “price of money,” inasmuch as it is the amount one must pay to use somebody else’s money (“borrow”) for a given period of time; the term is also used for the payment the lender (e.g., a person with a savings account) receives for loaning out his money. Because inflation lowers the value of currency, economists routinely distinguish between nominal interest rates (the actual amount earned by a lender/saver) and real interest rates (which are corrected for the inflation rate). A savings account earning 5% interest is not acquiring the ability to buy more things if prices are also going up by 5% per year!\n\nComparative advantage. Comparative advantage is the idea that every pair of potential trading partners (two firms, two neighbors, two countries, etc.) can benefit by trade if they are producing at least two goods. The counterintuitive aspect is that this result is true for every pair, no matter how unproductive one of the parties might be (in absolute terms). Broadly speaking, each party should specialize in what it does best (relative to the other party) and then trade for everything else. David Ricardo formulated this theory with a famous example involving Britain’s cloth industry and Portugal’s wine industry.\n\nInvisible hand. The invisible hand is the metaphorical notion that producers and consumers acting in their own narrow interest (e.g., by trying to maximize income from their business) will create an overall benefit to society. This might happen by their rewarding technologies that make production more efficient, rewarding firms who can sell at lower cost, rewarding inventors who discover new processes, and so on. The phrase was introduced by Adam Smith in his 1776 book The Wealth of Nations, but the modern understanding (and broad-based application of the metaphor) is due to later thinkers."

    "title": "Space Missions",
    "content": "Apollo 11 saw the first Moon landing and moonwalk by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (astronaut Michael Collins piloted the Command Module in lunar orbit and never walked on the moon). After the Lunar Module landed in the Sea of Tranquility, Armstrong said, “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.” Later stepping onto the lunar surface, he said, “That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” According to Chris Kraft, NASA officials chose Armstrong as the first to walk on the Moon because he was more humble than Aldrin, and because he was the Commander. However, the stated reason was that Armstrong’s seat was closer to the door. Apollo 11, like other Apollo missions, launched atop a Saturn V booster.\n\nVostok 1 and Vostok 6 transported the first human and the first woman into space (respectively, Yuri Gagarin and Valentina Tereshkova). Gagarin’s April 12, 1961 flight is still celebrated as Yuri’s Night. During Vostok 1, Gagarin completed a single orbit around Earth before re-entering and parachuting out of his capsule. Vostok 6 was largely uneventful, though Tereshkova did note minor physical pains and also could not reach the scientific experiments aboard. Both Vostok 1 and 6 used Vostok-K boosters.\n\nThe launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, by the USSR kicked off the so-called “Space Race.” The Space Race was manifestation of the Cold War where successes in launching objects and people into space was seen as a proxy for capacity to build intercontinental ballistic missiles. Sputnik 1 was originally intended to carry many scientific instruments, but those instruments were descoped, in favor of a simple radio transmitter. That transmitter broadcasted a “beep” at a specified interval, allowing scientists to map its deceleration as a result of atmospheric drag. Sputnik 1 was followed by Sputnik 2, which carried a dog named Laika (meaning “barker”) into low-earth orbit, and was destroyed upon re-entry.\n\nVoskhod 1 and Voskhod 2 were the only two missions of the Voskhod program, and were superseded quickly by the Soyuz program. The spacecrafts made use of Sergei Korolev’s designs. Korolev himself was preoccupied with the Moon race, again in a position of favor after the fall of Khrushchev (though Korolev died before the designs were used). Voskhod 1 was the first flight to contain multiple astronauts, and Voskhod 2 was the platform for the first EVA (extra-vehicular activity or “spacewalk”). Alexey Leonov, who conducted the spacewalk on Voskhod 2, also participated in the later Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.\n\nApollo 13 was supposed to land in the Fra Mauro region of the Moon. An improperly-refurbished No. 2 oxygen tank and subsequent improper repairs caused the tank to rupture during a routine “cryo-stir” before entering lunar orbit. The explosion also damaged the No. 1 oxygen tank and caused further leakage. To bring back the astronauts, the orbiter was put on a free-return trajectory around the Moon. NASA engineers also solved power-management, water-conservation, and trajectory planning problems with the help of Ken Mattingly, the primary Command Module pilot who had been grounded due to exposure to German measles. All three astronauts returned to Earth safely, and the landing site was re-assigned to the subsequent Apollo 14 mission.\n\nApollo 1 was intended to be a test of the Command/Service Module in low-Earth orbit (LEO). However, a fire on the launchpad during a test killed the three astronauts aboard (Virgil “Gus” Grissom, Roger Chaffee, and Ed White). The fire was exacerbated by the pure-oxygen, positive-pressure environment inside the capsule, and the fact that the capsule door opened inward. Both of these design elements were scrapped in subsequent missions, and the second was replaced with an outward-opening hatch nominally to facilitate spacewalks. Lessons learned from Apollo 1 were also taken into account during the design of the Space Shuttle.\n\nSTS-51-L and STS-107 (the Challenger and Columbia accidents respectively) are two Space Shuttle (or Space Transportation System) launches known mostly for their accidents and subsequent losses of life. The Challenger disaster was attributed by the Rogers Commission (the investigative body set up after the accident) to poor performance of the solid rocket booster (SRB) O-rings. The O-rings lost integrity and became brittle at low temperatures, such as those present on the morning of the launch. The failure of the O-rings caused “blow-by,” where hot gasses escaped the booster joint, ultimately resulting in the destruction of Challenger. The Rogers Commission also cited both NASA and SRB contractor Morton Thiokol for a failure to redesign the SRB joint, known to be dangerous—manifestations of “go fever.” According to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, the disaster on STS-107 was due to a piece of foam from the external fuel tank hitting and breaching the left wing of the Orbiter during launch. The breach damaged the heat shielding, allowing hot gas to enter the Orbiter during re-entry. Ultimately, that damage caused the vehicle to disintegrate over Texas. Both missions resulted in the complete loss of crew (seven crew were on each mission) and orbiters. Both modes of failure had been previously observed in earlier missions, but went un-fixed because those missions were successful.\n\nThe Apollo-Soyuz Test Project marked a definite end to the Space Race, and was a symbol of the de-escalation of tensions between the US and the USSR. Deke Slayton, an original Mercury 7 astronaut grounded for medical reasons until 1973, was accompanied by Tom Stafford and Vance Brand on the last launch of Apollo before the advent of the Space Shuttle. The mission demonstrated that two dissimilar spacecraft could rendezvous and dock while in space (an Apollo Command Module and Soyuz 19 docked), and also enabled the crew of Soyuz to photograph the Sun’s corona through an artificial eclipse created by the Apollo spacecraft. Each spacecraft also carried out independent experiments.\n\nSpaceX CRS-1 (also called SpX-1 or CRS-1) was the first commercial mission to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). A structural failure in one of the nine Merlin engines that make up the Falcon 9 rocket first stage necessitated a longer burn with the remaining eight engines. That correction resulted in a proper orbital insertion for the primary payload (a Dragon resupply vehicle), but an unstable, decaying orbit for its secondary payload (an ORBCOMM satellite). This was taken as a proof of concept by SpaceX for the redundant, multiple-engine design. The craft successfully berthed with the ISS and successfully carried out its primary mission, re-supplying the space station and returning cargo to Earth.\n\nHubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions (SM1, SM2, SM3A, SM3B, and SM4) all utilized spacewalks staged from a Space Shuttle. SM1 corrected Hubble’s flawed optics by installing COSTAR (a corrective optics system) while removing the High-Speed Photometer to make room. It also replaced the original Wide Field and Planetary Camera (or WFPC “wiff-pick”) with WFPC2, a camera that had optical correction built in. SM2 replaced the Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) and Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) with improved successors. SM3A replaced failed gyroscope systems. SM3B replaced the Faint Object Camera (FOC) with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), and also repaired NICMOS, which was installed during SM2. SM4 was originally cancelled after the Columbia Disaster by then-NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe, but was revived by Michael Griffin, who took over the post in 2005. SM4 installed WFC3 (made from some parts of the original WFPC) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), and conducted other repairs. No further repairs are planned, as much of HST’s functionality will be replicated with the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2021."

    "title": "Secretaries Of State",
    "content": "Thomas Jefferson (served 1790–1793 under President Washington): Known more for his presidency and completing the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson began his feud with Alexander Hamilton while serving as Secretary of State, even though his office had no bearing on Hamilton’s Treasury. He founded the Democratic-Republicans. He resigned his post after failing to secure from the British compensation for released slaves, withdrawal from garrisons in the Northwest Territory, and admission of violating the terms of the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War.\n\nHenry Clay (served 1825–1829 under President John Quincy Adams): Clay helped negotiate the “corrupt bargain” that led to John Quincy Adams winning the House vote that decided the presidency in 1824 and led to his appointment as Secretary of State. While Clay served in that post, his slave, Charlotte Dupuy, sued for her freedom in a move that foreshadowed the Dred Scott case. He lost presidential elections as a Whig candidate three times prior to his involvement in the Compromise of 1850.\n\nDaniel Webster (served 1841–1843 under Presidents Harrison and Tyler, then again from 1850–1852 under President Fillmore): Webster negotiated the Webster-Ashburton treaty that defined the border between Maine and New Brunswick (the Eastern border) and left his post in 1843 under pressure from Whigs, who had resigned in protest from Tyler’s cabinet over the issue of the national bank. In his second term, he upheld the Compromise of 1850, which cost him popularity with his fellow New Englanders.\n\nWilliam H. Seward (served 1861–1869 under Presidents Lincoln and Johnson): Seward wanted to resign prior to Lincoln’s inauguration, but the request was denied. Prior to the purchase of Alaska (“Seward’s Folly”), he helped set the conditions that ended the Atlantic slave trade in the Lyons-Seward treaty between the U.S. and U.K. He survived an assassination attempt the night Lincoln was shot. The purchase of Alaska was completed on March 30, 1867 for close to two cents an acre from Russia.\n\nJohn Hay (served 1898–1905 under Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt): Hay negotiated the 1898 Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish-American War and established the “open door policy” with China. He also served as Lincoln’s personal secretary while working as a clerk in the Interior Department. He negotiated the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty that established the Panama Canal Zone in 1903.\n\nElihu Root (served 1905–1909 under President T. Roosevelt): Succeeding Hay after Hay’s death, he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1912 for attempting to bring nations together for arbitration and cooperative agreements. During his tenure, he moved the consular service under the umbrella of the civil service. His negotiations with Great Britain settled border disputes regarding Alaska and Canada, and he was a proponent of free trade policies with China that Hay established.\n\nCordell Hull (served 1933–1944 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt): Known as “Father of the United Nations,” Hull was a Nobel Peace Prize recipient in 1945 for his work in founding that organization. He sent a namesake note to Japan prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor making a futile attempt to force the Japanese out of French Indochina, China, and Manchukuo, in accordance with his predecessor’s Stimson Doctrine.\n\nGeorge Marshall (served 1947–1949 under President Truman): As a general, he oversaw the largest expansion of the U.S. military in its history and wrote the central strategy for the Allies in Europe. He helped devise, and is the namesake of, the Marshall Plan to help Europe recover after World War II from 1948 to 1952. After he left his post, he was president of the American Red Cross. He correctly predicted that Israel’s declaration of statehood would lead to war and attempted to mediate the Chinese Civil War.\n\nDean Acheson (served 1949–1953 under President Truman): The successor to Marshall, he is known primarily for developing the policy of containment — designed to prevent the spread of Communism — and the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. His autobiography Present at the Creation is a major source for Cold War historians.\n\nHenry Kissinger (served 1973–1977 under Presidents Nixon and Ford): Kissinger held the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks that resulted in SALT I with the Soviet Union and pursued the “détente” policy to de-escalate the Cold War. He was instrumental in opening relations with China in 1972. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 for the negotiation of Paris Peace Accords and ceasefires that ended the Vietnam War. Kissinger used “shuttle diplomacy” to settle the Yom Kippur War among Egypt, Syria, and Israel.\n\nHillary Clinton (served 2009–2013 under President Obama): Hillary Rodham Clinton is a former Senator from New York and the wife of former president William Jefferson Clinton. President Clinton appointed Hillary as the face of the failed 1993 health care bill. She also sought the Democratic nomination for President in 2008, losing to eventual President Barack Obama. During her term, she presented a “reset button” to Russia and accepted formal responsibility for failures in consulate security that led to death of Ambassador Christopher Stephens in Benghazi.\n\nJohn Kerry (served 2014–2016 under President Obama): Kerry served as a senator from Massachusetts — spending the majority of his time as the junior senator to Ted Kennedy — and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He received the Democratic Party nomination for President in 2004, but lost the general election to George W. Bush. His major foreign policy involvement was in the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran."

    "title": "Scientific Experiments",
    "content": "Thomas Young’s double-slit experiment (circa 1800), which predated the development of quantum mechanics by over a century, demonstrated that light can behave as either a wave or a particle. After passing a beam of light through two narrowly spaced slits, Young observed the characteristic light and dark fringes of interference seen when light acts as a wave. More modern versions that add detectors showing which slit the light passes through, however, show that the light passes through one slit or the other, acting as photons; moreover, the interference pattern disappears. A modern variant, called a quantum eraser, demonstrates quantum entanglement (the ability to exchange information over large distances instantaneously).\n\nThe Michelson-Morley experiment (1887), conducted by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley at what is now Case Western Reserve University, disproved the existence of the luminiferous aether, a hypothetical medium through which light waves supposedly moved. (The aether is sometimes called simply “ether,” but is not to be confused with ethers from organic chemistry.) The experiment used an interferometer, a device that splits a beam of light and aims it using mirrors to allow the beam to interfere with itself; the interferometer was mounted on a slab of marble floating in a pool of mercury so that it could turn without friction, to eliminate the possibility that the interferometer was misoriented. While Michelson and Morley expected to find a shift in the interference pattern’s fringes as a result of the ether, the experiment showed that the Earth had no motion relative to the ether, suggesting that the ether did not exist. Often called the most famous failed experiment in science, the Michelson-Morley experiment is a fundamental test of special relativity.\n\nThe Millikan oil-drop experiment (1909), performed by Robert A. Millikan and Harvey Fletcher to measure the charge of the electron. In the first step, the terminal velocity of an oil drop was measured, which means that the drag force (which can be calculated using Stokes’ law) equals the force of gravity. From this, the mass can be calculated. Then, by turning on an electric field, the particle starts to move upward with a terminal velocity when the electric force balances out the forces of gravity and drag. Using this, and the mass of the drop, the total charge on the drop can be calculated. Millikan and Fletcher found that the total charge on the drops were always quantized—that is, always an integer multiple of some constant; specifically, the constant they found is about 1.59 × 10–19 coulombs, within 1% of the currently accepted value.\n\nThe Rutherford gold foil experiment (1908–1913), sometimes named after Rutherford’s assistants Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, discovered the positively-charged nucleus of the atom; as a result, it disproved J. J. Thomson’s plum pudding model. The experimenters fired alpha particles (helium nuclei) at a sheet of gold foil. (They also used other elements, including silver.) The scattered particles were detected by a screen containing zinc sulfide, which fluoresced when the alpha particles hit it. While most of the alpha particles went straight through the foil with minimal scattering, a small fraction of alpha particles were reflected back at the source. This result was unexpected, as backscattering could only occur if the alpha particles were colliding with a particle massive enough to reverse their momentum. Rutherford said “It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.”\n\nThe Stern-Gerlach experiment (1922), conducted by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach, demonstrated that the angular momentum of an atom is quantized. A beam of silver atoms was fired through an inhomogeneous magnetic field (one that varies through space). Instead of hitting a screen in a continuous distribution, they hit at discrete points, demonstrating the quantized nature of angular momentum. This experiment was actually performed several years before the concept of electron spin was even proposed. A variant on this experiment was used to create an energy source for the first hydrogen maser.\n\nThe Davisson-Germer experiment (1923–1927), performed by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer, confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis by showing that electrons can exhibit wave-like behavior. The experimenters fired electrons at a nickel crystal, and measured the diffraction patterns using an electron counter called a Faraday box (or Faraday cup) mounted on an arc so that it could detect electrons emitted at various angles. The peak intensity was observed at 50 degrees and 54 electronvolts, corresponding to the diffraction predicted for X-rays by Bragg’s law. (Note that diffraction is a property of waves, not particles, and thus could only be observed if electrons can act as waves.)\n\nGregor Mendel’s experiments with pea plants (1860s) pioneered the study of genetics. Mendel, an Austrian monk, proposed the law of segregation, which holds that each organism has two alleles for each trait, which are segregated into gametes so that each gamete inherits one copy, as well as the law of independent assortment, which says that genes for individual traits are inherited independently. He supported both of those laws with experimental evidence by growing and counting pea plants. He worked with seven characteristics including plant height, seed shape, and color. His experiments primarily consisted of hybridizing plants with certain characteristics, and observing what fraction of the next generation had certain traits. His results were remarkably close to the values that would be predicted from modern genetics—close enough, in fact, that Mendel has been accused of manipulating his data.\n\nThe Hershey-Chase experiment (1952), by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase, demonstrated that the material responsible for inheritance of traits was DNA rather than protein. The experiment was carried out by creating radiolabeled T2 bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). In one population, the phages’ DNA contained phosphorus-32 in its backbone; in the other population, the phages’ proteins contained sulfur-35. The phages were then allowed to infect E. coli. After using a centrifuge to remove the viral coats from the bacteria, Hershey and Chase found that the viruses labeled with sulfur did not transfer their radioactivity to the cells, while the viruses labeled with phosphorus did. This result, combined with other experiments, demonstrated that the genetic material was DNA, not protein.\n\nThe Miller-Urey experiment (1952) was an attempt to demonstrate a possible mechanism—proposed by John Haldane and Alexander Oparin—for how life could form from inorganic chemicals. Stanley Miller and Harold Urey modeled Earth’s prebiotic atmosphere as a mixture of water, methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and hydrogen. They allowed those four substances to react in an apparatus over a one-week period; the apparatus included a heater to convert the water to water vapor and an electrode to simulate lightning strikes. The resulting mixture contained more than 20 distinct amino acids that formed spontaneously; a more modern \"volcanic\" version of the experiment produced even more amino acids by including sulfur compounds.\n\nThe Meselson-Stahl experiment (1958) proved that DNA replication is semiconservative, meaning that when a double-helix strand of DNA is duplicated, the result is two double-helix strands, each of which has one helix from the parent molecule and one newly-synthesized helix. Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl used E. coli grown in a medium containing only nitrogen-15; they were then allowed to synthesize DNA in an environment containing only nitrogen-14 over two generations. The net result was that in the second generation, half the DNA molecules contained nitrogen-15 in one strand and nitrogen-14 in the other, while the other half of the molecules contained only nitrogen-14."

    "content": "The Pyramids (July 21, 1798, Egypt) and the Nile (August 1–3, 1798, Egypt) After his victory over Austria, Napoleon proposed crossing the Mediterranean and invading Egypt. While the stated goal of this expedition was to strike a blow against British trade with the Middle East and Asia, it also catered to Napoleon’s fascination with antiquity. A team of scientists followed his military expedition, whose most lasting result was the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, unearthed by soldiers digging to construct a fort in the Nile delta. Napoleon supposedly cried “Soldiers, forty centuries look down upon you” at the 1798 Battle of the Pyramids, where his troops used modern artillery and large square formations to ward off a cavalry charge by the Egyptian Mamluks. French control of Egypt, however, was dependent on communications across the Mediterranean, which were interrupted by the Royal Navy’s attack on the French fleet in Aboukir Bay in early August. British victory at the Nile forced Napoleon to abandon his army and return to France.\n\nMarengo (June 14, 1800, northern Italy) The coup of 18 Brumaire (November 9, 1799) brought down France’s existing government (the Directory) and made Napoleon himself “first consul,” the effective leader of France. While Napoleon was absent in Egypt, a coalition of Austria, Russia, and Britain had pushed French troops back on all fronts. In 1800 Napoleon marched over the Alps to roll back Austrian gains in Italy. His troops, overextended in an attempt to relieve the Austrian siege of Genoa, were hit by an Austrian surprise attack on June 14, 1800. General Louis Desaix led a column of French reinforcements to Napoleon’s aid; the additional troops drove off the Austrian army, but Desaix was shot and killed.\n\nTrafalgar (October 21, 1805, off the coast of southwestern Spain) In 1804 Napoleon abolished the consulate and became France’s emperor. He faced an array of enemies who made up the “Third Coalition”: the humiliated Austrians sought military aid from both Russia and Britain. France and Spain allied in the hope of challenging the Royal Navy and making it possible for Napoleon’s armies to launch an invasion of Britain. Trafalgar, fought in the Atlantic off the coast of Spain in the fall of 1805, was the last great naval battle of the Napoleonic era. A combined French and Spanish fleet under Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve was attacked by Royal Navy ships under Lord Horatio Nelson, Britain’s greatest admiral. Just before the battle, Nelson’s flagship — the HMS Victory — flew the signal “England expects that every man will do his duty.” Although Nelson was killed by a French sniper in the battle that followed, his ships captured half of the French fleet, including Admiral Villeneuve. French plans to invade Britain were postponed indefinitely.\n\nAusterlitz (December 2, 1805, Czech Republic) Napoleon’s Grand Army then struck east at Austria and Russia, the land-bound members of the Third Coalition. Napoleon’s first move was to force the surrender of 30,000 Austrians under General Mack at Ulm. The French then turned east into the heart of Austria, where they seized Vienna and awaited counterattack by the Russians. At Austerlitz on December 2, 1805, a mostly-Russian coalition army collided with the waiting French. (The Russians, led in person by Tsar Alexander I, were joined by the scattered remains of the Austrian army under Holy Roman Emperor Francis II. Austerlitz is thus known as the “Battle of the Three Emperors.”) The allies, planning to advance their left, abandoned the Pratzen Heights, a dominating hill in the center of the battlefield. Napoleon seized the heights, splitting the Russian army and then defeating each half in turn. The resulting Peace of Pressburg (December 26, 1805) ended the War of the Third Coalition and brought about the downfall of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nJena-Auerstedt (October 14, 1806, Germany) In 1806 Napoleon turned his forces against Prussia. At the twin October battles Jena and Auerstedt, Napoleon and Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout worked together to smash a Prussian army led by the Duke of Brunswick, who was mortally wounded by Davout’s troops near Auerstadt. The collapse of the Prussian army, widely considered the continent’s most experienced and professional military force, shocked European observers. Napoleon felt that he had secured revenge for Frederick the Great’s victory over France at Rossbach in the Seven Years’ War (1757).\n\nSalamanca (July 22, 1812, Spain) While Napoleon struggled against Austrians, Russians, and Prussians on the plains of central and eastern Europe, a smaller but no less violent conflict was fought for control of Spain and Portugal. During this “Peninsular War” (1807–1814), the throne of Spain was claimed by Napoleon’s older brother, Joseph Bonaparte. Spanish and Portuguese resistance (the first “guerrilla” warfare, from the Spanish for “little war”) was supported by the landing of British troops under the command of the Duke of Wellington. Wellington’s triumph over Marshal Auguste Marmont at Salamanca in July 1812 was a decisive blow against the stability of Joseph’s regime.\n\nBorodino (September 7, 1812, Russia) In 1812 Napoleon assembled the largest army of his reign for the most ambitious military operation of the 19th century: a full-scale invasion of Russia. Russian Tsar Alexander I, despite losing to Napoleon in central Europe between 1805 and 1807, refused to agree to the “Continental System,” the Napoleonic proposal for a Europe-wide embargo on British trade in manufactured goods. Napoleon’s march on Moscow was slowed by Russian resistance at Borodino, where Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov’s army was driven out of fortified redoubts after a day of destructive fighting. Although French forces were briefly able to seize control of Moscow, the subsequent retreat through the worst of the Russian winter ruined Napoleon’s Grand Army.\n\nLeipzig (October 16–19, 1813, Germany) The following year the Russian army marched west into central Europe at the head of a “Sixth Coalition” that brought the previously defeated Austrians and Prussians back into hostilities against France. At Leipzig in central Germany, coalition forces met a hastily-assembled replacement army raised by Napoleon after the disaster in Russia. More than 600,000 men fought in this four-day struggle, popularly known as the “Battle of the Nations” for the multi-ethnic nature of the coalition army. The forces of Saxony, one of the minor German states, switched sides during the Battle of Leipzig, leaving Napoleon’s army to join the allies. The premature destruction of a bridge over the River Elster hindered Napoleon’s retreat from Leipzig, the first in a series of military disasters that led to the emperor’s forced abdication and exile to the Mediterranean island Elba in 1814.\n\nWaterloo (June 18, 1815, Belgium) Napoleon’s escape from Elba began a period known as the “Hundred Days,” in which the emperor briefly returned to the throne of France. The struggle between the restored emperor and the “Seventh Coalition” began when Napoleon’s Army of the North marched into the Low Countries, hoping for a showdown with the British, Dutch, and Prussians before the Austrian and Russian armies gathering further east could come to their aid. The French brushed aside Allied advance guards at the two preliminary battles Quatre Bras and Ligny on June 16. Napoleon’s victory over the Prussians at Ligny led him to falsely believe that he had enough time to pursue and defeat the British without further Prussian interference. On June 18 Napoleon’s advance on Brussels approached the crossroads of Mont St. Jean, where the Duke of Wellington had set up a defensive position for a combined army of British Peninsular War veterans, Dutch, and pro-British Germans. On the French left, British troops defended the walled farm Hougoumont from a series of infantry assaults; in the center, Marshal Michel Ney’s massed cavalry charge was broken by the square formations of the British infantry; on the right, Gebhard von Blücher’s Prussian army arrived to attack the French army in the flank. Napoleon’s final gamble was to commit his Imperial Guard to a renewed assault on the Allied center. The guardsmen were cut down by the fire of British light infantry, leading to the general collapse of the French army. Napoleon was exiled once more, this time to the isolated South Atlantic island St. Helena, where he died in 1821."

    "title": "Classifications Of Mathematical Functions",
    "content": "Polynomials are functions made of terms added together, in which each term is a number times a product of variables raised to nonnegative-integer powers. For instance, 3x2y and –πx7y2z3 are each terms, so 3x2y – πx7y2z3 is a polynomial. (Individual terms are also considered polynomials.) Much of math is concerned with polynomials involving only one variable, such as –x3 + 2x2. The number at the beginning of each term is called a coefficient. Since simple numbers (“constants”) can also be written as the same number times any variable to the zeroth power (that is, 6 is the same as 6x0), numbers are also considered terms and polynomials. So x + 6 is a polynomial, as is just –4. Polynomials can be classified according to their number of terms: a polynomial with one term, like 2x or –12x2, is called a monomial; a polynomial with two terms is called a binomial; and a polynomial with three terms is called a trinomial. Each polynomial has a degree. For polynomials of one variable, the degree is the largest exponent on the variable, so for the polynomial 4x3 – x2, the degree is 3. For polynomials of multiple variables, to find the degree you calculate the sum of the variables’ exponents on each term, then choose the largest such sum, so the degree of 3x6y5 – x2y3 is calculated by adding 6+5 = 11 for the first term and 2+3 = 5 for the second and noting that 11 is larger, so the degree is 11. A polynomial that is just a constant has degree 0. A polynomial with degree 1, like 3x, is called linear; a polynomial with degree 2, like 3x2 – 8x + 4, is called quadratic; a polynomial with degree 3 is called cubic; continuing with increasing degrees, the terms are quartic, quintic, sextic, and so on, though terms corresponding to degrees larger than 5 are seldom used. For technical reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, the zero polynomial (i.e., f(x) = 0) is said to have a degree of –∞ or an undefined degree. The fundamental theorem of algebra is the statement that every single-variable polynomial, other than constants, has a root in the complex numbers, which means that if f(x) is a polynomial, then the equation f(x) = 0 has at least one solution where x is some complex number. There are formulas to find those roots for linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials, though the latter two formulas are extremely complicated. The Abel-Ruffini theorem, also called Abel’s impossibility theorem, is the statement that there is no way to find a formula for the solutions of all quintic or higher-degree polynomials, if the formula must be based on the traditional operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, and exponentiation/taking roots). That impossibility is the topic that began an area of study called Galois gal-wah theory, which is part of abstract algebra.\n\nQuadratics are, as mentioned above, polynomials of degree 2. The graph of a quadratic equation will be in the shape of a parabola that opens straight up (if the coefficient on the x2 term is positive) or straight down (if that coefficient is negative). It is possible to find the roots of a quadratic by graphing it, factoring it, completing the square on it, or using the quadratic formula (itself derived by completing the square) on it. If the quadratic is in the form ax2 + bx + c, then the expression b2 – 4ac, which appears in the quadratic formula, is called the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic will have two real roots; if the discriminant is zero, the quadratic will have one real root (said to have a multiplicity of 2); and if the discriminant is negative, the quadratic will have two non-real complex roots (and if the coefficients of the quadratic are real numbers, the complex roots will be conjugates of each other).\n\nRational functions consist of one polynomial divided by another polynomial. The denominator polynomial cannot be the zero polynomial, because dividing by zero is undefined. Examples therefore include 1/x, x2/(x – 3), and (x2 + 1)/(x2 – 1). Every polynomial can be considered to be a rational function because 1 is a polynomial and dividing by 1 doesn’t change an expression (so to consider the polynomial x3 as a rational function, think of it as x3/1). It is often instructive to study the asymptotes of rational functions, which are places in which their graphs approach a line (or occasionally other shape), usually getting infinitely close to but not crossing it. That analysis may require performing long division on the numerator and denominator polynomials to find their greatest common factor.\n\nPeriodic functions are those whose graph repeats a pattern (specifically, the graph has translational symmetry). Technically speaking, a function of one variable f is periodic if f(x+p) = f(x) for every x in the domain of the function and some positive number p, which is called the period, because the graph repeats itself every p units. While the trigonometric functions are the periodic functions most commonly encountered by high school math students, some other functions like triangle waves are also periodic; in general, functions representing waves tend to be periodic. A Fourier fur-ee-ay series is a way to rewrite (almost) any periodic function in terms of only sine and cosine functions.\n\nThe trigonometric functions represent relations between angles and sides of triangles. They are often illustrated using points and segments related to a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, called the unit circle. By far the most commonly discussed trigonometric functions are the sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions. There are many interesting relationships between these: the graphs of sine and cosine are translations of each other; the tangent function equals the sine function divided by the cosine function; the cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions are the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, respectively; and there are many other relationships called trigonometric identities.\n\nThe inverse trigonometric functions are, as one might expect, the inverse functions of the trigonometric functions. (Note that “inverse” in this case refers to a function that “undoes” another, not to “multiplicative inverse,” also called “reciprocal.”) They are sometimes just called “inverse sine,” etc, and are also given with the prefix “arc”: arcsine, arccosine, arctangent, arccosecant, arcsecant, and arccotangent. They are sometimes notated in the form sin–1 for arcsine, but that notation can be confusing, so NAQT tends to prefer “arcsine,” etc. Because the trigonometric functions are not bijective (see below), to have inverses it is necessary to restrict the domains of the inverse trigonometric functions; for instance, arcsin(x) is only defined for x between –1 and 1, inclusive.\n\nInjective functions, or injections, are functions that do not repeat any outputs. For instance, f(x) = 2x is injective, because for every possible output value, there is only one input that will result in that output. On the other hand, f(x) = sin(x) is not injective, because (for instance) the output 0 can be obtained from several different inputs (0, π, 2π, and so on). If you have the graph of a function, you can determine whether the function is injective by applying the horizontal line test: if no horizontal line would ever intersect the graph twice, the function is injective. Surjective functions, or surjections, are functions that achieve every possible output. For instance, if you are thinking of functions whose domain and codomain are both the set of all real numbers, then f(x) = tan(x) is surjective, because every real number is an output for some input. But f(x) = x2 is not surjective, because (for instance) –3 is not an output for any real-number input. The term image is sometimes used for the set of all output values that a function actually achieves; a surjective function, then, is one whose image equals its codomain. A function that is both injective and surjective is called bijective, or a bijection. If a function is bijective, then it has an inverse. Furthermore, a function can only have an inverse if it is bijective.\n\nEven functions satisfy the rule f(–x) = f(x) for every x in the domain of the function. The graph of an even function has reflection symmetry over the y-axis. Even functions are so named because if a polynomial’s exponents (on the variable) are all even, then the polynomial is an even function; for instance, x2, 3x6, and –x8 + 7x4 are all even. There are other even functions, though, such as the cosine and absolute value functions. Odd functions satisfy the rule f(–x) = –f(x) for every x in the domain of the function. The graph of an odd function remains the same when it is rotated 180° around the origin. Odd functions are so named because if a polynomial’s exponents (on the variable) are all odd, then the polynomial is an odd function; for instance, x3, 4x7, and –x5 + 2x3 are all odd. There are other odd functions, such as the sine and cube root functions. Many functions are neither even nor odd, such as x2 + x. Only one function is both even and odd: the zero function, f(x) = 0.\n\nExponential functions are those of the form f(x) = bx, where b (called the base) is a positive number other than 1. Exponential functions are used to model unrestricted growth (such as compound interest, and animal populations with unlimited food and no predators) and decay (such as radioactive decay). The phrase “the exponential function” refers to the function f(x) = ex, where e is a specific irrational number called Euler’s number, about equal to 2.718. Exponential functions have the interesting property that their derivatives are proportional to themselves.\n\nLogarithmic functions, or logarithms, are functions of the form f(x) = logbx, where b is again a positive number other than 1 (and again called the base). They are the inverses of the exponential functions with the same bases. Logarithmic functions are used to model sensory perception and some phenomena in probability and statistics. The phrase “the logarithm” can refer to a logarithmic function using the base 2 (especially in computer science; this is also called the binary logarithm), e (especially in higher math), or 10 (especially in lower levels of math and physical sciences). The phrase natural logarithm refers to the logarithm base e, and the phrase common logarithm usually refers to the logarithm base 10.\n\nContinuous functions, studied in calculus, are functions where the limit approaching each point equals the function’s value at that point. In particular, there are no holes, jumps, or asymptotes “in the middle of the graph.” Continuity is really a property of a specific point; a continuous function is a function that is continuous at every point. Continuity is often explained as a function’s graph being drawable in one motion without lifting the writing utensil from the paper. All polynomials are continuous, as are the sine and cosine functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and the absolute value function. Some examples of non-continuous functions are many rational functions, as they often have holes or asymptotes; the tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions, which have asymptotes; and the floor and ceiling functions, which have jumps.\n\nDifferentiable functions, also studied in calculus, are functions for which the derivative can be found (because a particular limit, called a difference quotient, exists). Like continuity, differentiability is really a property of a specific point, and a differentiable function is one that is differentiable at every point. Every differentiable function is continuous, but some continuous functions are not differentiable; mathematicians thus say that differentiability is a stronger property than continuity. In terms of graphs, a differentiable function has a “smooth” graph with no corners or cusps (and also, because continuity is required, no holes, jumps, or asymptotes). All polynomials are differentiable, as are the sine and cosine functions, and exponential and logarithmic functions. However, the absolute value function f(x) = |x| is not differentiable because it has a “corner” at x = 0 (but recall that it is still continuous)."

    "title": "Choreographers",
    "content": "Martha Graham (1894–1991) was the first dancer invited to perform at the White House. As a choreographer, she developed the “Graham technique” that creates dramatic tension through “contraction” and “release” of major muscles. Her first major success was her 1958 concert-length ballet Clytemnestra, one of four collaborations with composer Halim Ed-Dabh. She performed the title role in Clytemnestra with her namesake dance company, whose dancers included Merce Cunningham and her husband, Erick Hawkins, both of whom went on to become choreographers in their own right. Hawkins danced the male lead in Appalachian Spring, a ballet with “an American theme” that Graham commissioned from Aaron Copland.\n\nMichel Fokine (1880–1942) was accepted to the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg, Russia, at age nine, eventually becoming a teacher there. He choreographed a four-minute ballet for Anna Pavlova called The Dying Swan, set to “The Swan” from The Carnival of the Animals (the title comes from a Tennyson poem entitled “The Dying Swan”). He mentored Vaslav Nijinsky and featured him in early works like Les Sylphides, a ballet based on the music of Frédéric Chopin. After Sergei Diaghilev hired Fokine to work for the Ballets Russes in Paris, Fokine showcased Nijinsky’s talents in several ballets based on the work of famous composers, such as Scheherazade, The Firebird, Petrushka, Daphnis et Chloé, and The Spirit of the Rose. However, once Nijinsky turned to choreography Fokine quit the Ballets Russes, only returning after Nijinsky’s dismissal.\n\nBob Fosse (1927–1987) came to prominence in the 1953 film Kiss Me Kate. While he and dance partner Carol Haney only had small roles, the dance that Fosse choreographed for them in the number “From This Moment On” launched Fosse’s career. Fosse’s unique style, featuring turned-in knees, rolled shoulders, sideways movement, and “jazz hands,” found its greatest expression on Broadway, where he choreographed the musicals The Pajama Game, Damn Yankees, Redhead, Sweet Charity, Pippin, and Chicago. Many of his works featured his wife Gwen Verdon, who won four Tonys under his choreography or direction. Fosse also directed the films Cabaret and All That Jazz, winning an Oscar for Cabaret. Many commentators have described his cameo as The Snake in a 1974 film adaptation of The Little Prince as a forerunner to the dance style of Michael Jackson.\n\nJerome Robbins (1918–1998) is probably best known for his work with Leonard Bernstein. He broke through as a choreographer with an experimental ballet about three sailors on leave in New York City, Fancy Free, which he then helped rework into the hit 1944 musical On the Town. Known for being temperamental and difficult to work with, he conceived, choreographed, and directed the 1957 original production of West Side Story and won an Oscar for co-directing the 1961 film version (despite quitting early in the process due to creative differences). He also choreographed and directed the original production of Fiddler on the Roof. He acted as an uncredited “show doctor,” rescuing several floundering Broadway shows, including A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum and Funny Girl.\n\nGeorge Balanchine (1904–1983) trained in his native Georgia (the country) and Russia and briefly worked with Sergei Diaghilev at the Ballets Russes in Paris before being invited by impresario Lincoln Kirstein to the United States, where the two co-founded the New York City Ballet (NYCB) and its associated School of American Ballet. As artistic director of NYCB, Balanchine began the tradition of annually staging The Nutcracker at Christmas. One of his four wives — all dancers — was the company’s first major star, Native American prima ballerina Maria Tallchief. He collaborated with composer Igor Stravinsky and visual artist Isamu Noguchi on the 30-minute ballet Orpheus.\n\nVaslav Nijinsky (1889–1950) was known as the greatest male dancer of his era, but what he really wanted to do was choreograph. His boss at the Ballets Russes, Sergei Diaghilev, gave him the opportunity in 1912 with The Afternoon of a Faun, set to the music of Claude Debussy, and a year later a riot broke out at the premiere of another ballet he choreographed, Igor Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring. (The exact cause of the riot is unclear.) In 1919 Nijinsky was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He never danced again in public, and spent much of the rest of his life in various asylums and institutions.\n\nAlvin Ailey (1931–1989) was a pioneering African-American choreographer. He originally danced in the Horton Dance Company run by his mentor Lester Horton. After Horton’s unexpected death in 1953, Ailey took over as its artistic director. In 1958 he formed Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York City. His best-known work, Revelations, was based on his upbringing in Texas and is divided into three parts, titled “Pilgrim of Sorrow,” “Take Me to the Water,” and “Move Members, Move.” “Move Members, Move” emphasizes gospel music, including the traditional spiritual “Sinner Man,” and concludes with the number “Rocka My Soul in the Bosom of Abraham,” which recreates a joyous church service.\n\nPierre Beauchamp (1631–1705) taught dance to French King Louis XIV at Versailles for over two decades. An early director of the Western world’s first dance institution, the Académie Royale de Danse, he collaborated extensively with Molière’s acting company and the composer Jean-Baptiste Lully. He is often credited with codifying the five basic feet positions in ballet. His system of dance notation, later revised by Raoul-Auger Feuillet and Pierre Rameau and today known as “Beauchamp-Feuillet notation,” was used until the late 1700s.\n\nAgnes de Mille (1905–1993), the niece of the film director Cecil B. DeMille and granddaughter of the economist Henry George, worked extensively with American Ballet Theater, but the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo commissioned her most famous work, Rodeo. That ballet, featuring music by Aaron Copland (possibly assisted by an uncredited Leonard Bernstein), details a love rectangle between characters known as American Cowgirl, Champion Roper, Head Wrangler, and Rancher’s Daughter. Her other notable stage ballets include Three Virgins and a Devil and Fall River Legend (based on the life of Lizzie Borden). De Mille also found success in musical theater, creating a revolutionary “dream ballet” for Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Oklahoma!.\n\nTwyla Tharp (1941–present) made her mark in the mid-1970s with the “crossover ballets” Deuce Coupe (performed by the Joffrey Ballet to music by The Beach Boys) and Push Comes to Shove (starring Mikhail Baryshnikov), both marked by a fusion of diverse musical and dance styles. She found success on Broadway with the “jukebox musical” Movin’ Out, set to the catalog of Billy Joel; she subsequently built musicals around the songs of Bob Dylan and Frank Sinatra. She created the children’s ballet The Princess and the Goblin and collaborated with director Milos Forman on the Hollywood films Hair, Ragtime, and Amadeus."

    "content": "Richard, Duke of Gloucester, from Richard III: The quintessential antihero, Richard describes how his hunchbacked appearance has made him “determined to prove a villain” in a monologue that begins “now is the winter of our discontent / made glorious summer by this son of York.” In the aftermath of a Yorkist victory in the Wars of the Roses, Richard plots against his brothers King Edward IV and George, Duke of Clarence, and causes Edward to imprison Clarence in the Tower of London. Assassins sent by Richard later kill Clarence, who is drowned in a “malmsey-butt,” or cask of wine. Richard also marries and kills the Lady Anne, and orders the deaths of Edward’s children (the “princes in the tower”). Although Richard becomes king, he soon faces a rebellion led by Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond. On the eve of a battle at Bosworth Field, Richard is haunted by the ghosts of those he wronged. The battle turns against Richard (who cries “a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!”), and Richmond is crowned as King Henry VII of England.\n\nLady Macbeth, from Macbeth: Though Macbeth is the play’s protagonist, his pursuit of the Scottish throne is largely driven by his wife’s ambition. After three witches predict that Macbeth will be king, Lady Macbeth fears that her husband is “too full ’o the milk of human kindness” to commit murder, and bids “spirits” to “unsex” her and imbue her with willpower. She insults Macbeth’s masculinity, and urges him to “screw [his] courage to the sticking-place” and kill King Duncan. When Macbeth is unable to frame two grooms for the murder, Lady Macbeth does so in his place. Later, Lady Macbeth is wracked with guilt for her actions. While sleepwalking, she tries to wash imaginary blood from her hands, and cries “out, damned spot!” In the final act, the news of her death prompts Macbeth to deliver the “tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow” soliloquy.\n\nIago, from The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice: Iago is the “ancient,” or standard-bearer, of the general Othello, and is passed over for a promotion to lieutenant in favor of the less-experienced Michael Cassio. In addition, Iago believes that his wife, Emilia, may have cheated on him with Othello. Consequently, Iago vows revenge. At the start of the play, Iago and his associate Roderigo alert the Venetian senator Brabantio that Brabantio’s daughter, Desdemona, has eloped with Othello. After Desdemona testifies that she married Othello willingly, the Duke of Venice places Othello in charge of defending Cyprus. On the island, Iago ingratiates himself with Othello, and deceitfully warns the general against the “green-eyed monster” of jealousy. Iago then places Desdemona’s handkerchief in Cassio’s room, causing Othello to believe that Desdemona and Cassio are having an affair. Once Othello has murdered Desdemona, Emilia exposes Iago’s plot. Before killing himself, Othello stabs Iago, who survives to be arrested by Cassio.\n\nTybalt, from Romeo and Juliet: Tybalt is a hot-headed member of the Capulet family who is the beloved cousin of Juliet. During the public brawl that begins the play, Tybalt provokes the peaceful Benvolio. At a ball given by the Capulets, Tybalt recognizes the disguised Romeo and calls for a sword, but is prevented from fighting by Lord Capulet. Tybalt then demands a duel with Romeo, who does not wish to fight one of Juliet’s kinsmen. Romeo’s friend Mercutio is shocked by this “vile submission,” and calls Tybalt “king of cats” while challenging him to a duel. (Tybalt shares his name with a feline character from medieval fables about Reynard the Fox.) Romeo tries to intervene in the duel, which allows Tybalt to kill Mercutio. Romeo then kills Tybalt, and is banished from Verona.\n\nKing Claudius, from The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark: Before the start of the play, Claudius became the ruler of Denmark by pouring poison into the ear of his sleeping brother, King Hamlet. Claudius then married Gertrude, King Hamlet’s widow. In the play’s first act, Prince Hamlet learns of his uncle’s treachery by speaking to King Hamlet’s ghost. Hamlet then arranges for a troupe of actors to perform a play titled The Murder of Gonzago, which Hamlet revises to increase the similarities to his father’s death. Claudius is disturbed by the performance, and storms out during the murder scene. Later, Claudius prays for forgiveness, causing Hamlet to delay killing him out of fear that Claudius’s soul would go to heaven. As Hamlet feigns madness, Claudius sends him to England with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who unknowingly carry a letter calling for Hamlet’s execution. After Hamlet escapes and returns to Denmark, Claudius arranges for Hamlet to fight a duel with Laertes, who seeks revenge for the death of his father, Polonius, and sister, Ophelia. Laertes uses a poison-tipped sword, and Claudius prepares a poisoned drink as a back-up. When Laertes falls in combat he reveals the plot, prompting Hamlet to stab Claudius with the poisoned sword, and make Claudius drink from the poisoned cup.\n\nRegan and the Duke of Cornwall, and Goneril and the Duke of Albany, from King Lear: Regan and Goneril are the elderly King Lear’s two evil daughters. After Lear bequeaths his kingdom to them, they conspire to undermine Lear’s remaining power and defeat Cordelia, Lear’s sole loyal daughter. Angered by the treatment that he has received from his heirs, Lear leaves Regan’s home in the middle of a thunderstorm. Gloucester, who desires Lear’s reinstatement, aids Cordelia’s invading army; he is exposed, and Regan and Cornwall gouge Gloucester’s eyes out. While Albany and Cornwall arrange their armies to fight Cordelia, Regan and Goneril both romantically pursue the villainous Edmund. This love triangle results in Goneril killing Regan with poison. Goneril also tries to have Albany killed, but commits suicide when the plot is exposed. Cordelia is captured and executed, and Lear dies of grief soon afterward, leaving the redeemed Albany and Edmund’s half-brother Edgar to take charge of the realm.\n\nCaliban, from The Tempest: Caliban is the son of the Algerian witch Sycorax, who once ruled the island where Caliban was born. After Sycorax died the island fell under the control of the magician Prospero, an exiled duke of Milan. Prospero taught the young Caliban language, and showed kindness to him, until Caliban tried to rape Prospero’s daughter Miranda. In response, Prospero enslaved Caliban, and began treating him as a subhuman creature. (Caliban’s exact nature is unknown, but he seems to be physically distinct from the other characters in the play. At various points, Caliban is called a “monster,” a “demi-devil,” a “strange fish,” a “thing of darkness,” a “moon-calf,” and a “freckled whelp” who lacks a “human shape.”) When the play begins, Caliban longs to overthrow Prospero but still fears Prospero’s magic, which is stronger than that of Caliban’s god, Setebos. Trinculo and Stephano, two drunkards who are shipwrecked and separated from the rest of their crew, give Caliban liquor; Caliban then conspires with them to kill Prospero. When the group hears music played by the spirit Ariel, Caliban delivers a speech beginning “Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises” that demonstrates sensitivity and loss. The plot to unseat Prospero quickly fails, and Caliban vows to be “wise hereafter.” Unlike Ariel, Caliban is not freed at the end of the play.\n\nDuke Frederick, from As You Like It: Before the opening of the play, Frederick overthrew his brother, Duke Senior, and seized control of the court. There, Frederick harbors his brother’s daughter Rosalind as a companion to his own daughter, Celia. When Frederick banishes Rosalind out of fear that she is plotting against him, Celia volunteers to go with her beloved cousin, and suggests that they reunite with Duke Senior in the Forest of Arden. At the same time, a young nobleman named Orlando flees to the Forest of Arden to escape his brother Oliver’s mistreatment. Frederick suspects that Orlando is in the company of Celia and Rosalind, and seizes Oliver’s lands until Orlando can be produced. After Oliver departs to search for his brother, Duke Frederick is not heard of again until the end of the play, when Oliver and Orlando’s brother Jaques reports that Frederick suddenly repented of his crimes after meeting “an old religious man.” Frederick relinquishes the crown to Duke Senior, and restores the property of Duke Senior’s supporters.\n\nProteus, from The Two Gentlemen of Verona: Proteus begins the play as an innocent lover, but develops into the primary antagonist after he visits his friend Valentine in Milan, and becomes infatuated with Valentine’s love, Silvia. Although Proteus has sworn that he will be faithful to a woman in Verona named Julia, he breaks his promise and tries to win Silvia for himself. To this end, Proteus betrays Valentine by telling Silvia’s father, the duke, that Valentine and Silvia plan to elope. After the duke exiles Valentine, Silvia rejects Proteus because of his treachery towards his friend, and his unfaithfulness to Julia. When Silvia escapes to the woods to find Valentine, Proteus follows her and rescues her from outlaws. Silvia continues to reject Proteus, who threatens to rape her (“I’ll force thee yield to my desire”) before Valentine intervenes. Proteus repents, and Julia — who has been disguised as Proteus’s male page — reveals herself. Proteus then reunites with Julia and resumes his friendship with Valentine, whom the duke permits to marry Silvia.\n\nAngelo, from Measure for Measure: Angelo is entrusted with the rule of Vienna by Duke Vicentio, who pretends to leave the city but actually remains present, disguised as “Friar Lodowick.” Angelo enforces antiquated laws against fornication, resulting in Claudio’s arrest and imminent execution. Claudio’s sister, the novice nun Isabella, pleads for Claudio to be pardoned; Angelo agrees, but only if Isabella will have sex with him. After debate, Duke Vincentio proposes a “bed trick”: Isabella pretends that she is willing to have sex with Angelo in absolute darkness and silence, which allows Mariana, a woman who was once betrothed to Angelo, to take Isabella’s place. Although the plan works, and Angelo believes that he had sex with Isabella, he goes back on his word and orders Claudio’s execution. This forces the duke to arrange a “head trick,” in which the head of the pirate Ragozine is presented to Angelo, and Claudio’s life is saved. Once the duke “returns” to Vienna, Isabella and Mariana petition him to right their wrongs. Angelo initially denies the charges brought against him, but confesses once he learns that the duke and Friar Lodowick are the same person. Angelo’s life is spared for Mariana’s sake, and the duke proposes marriage to Isabella."

    "title": "Chemical Elements",
    "content": "Hydrogen (atomic symbol H, atomic number 1) is the first element on the periodic table and, by far, the most common element in the Universe. In addition to the main isotope (also called protium), there are two other significant isotopes of hydrogen: deuterium (2H or D), which has one neutron, and tritium (3H or T), which has two neutrons. It naturally exists as a diatomic gas (H2), which was discovered by the British chemist Henry Cavendish. Hydrogen is highly flammable when exposed to high temperatures or electric current, a fact demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster. It can react with nonmetals by losing an electron to form the H+ ion, or react with metals to form the hydride ion, H–.\n\nHelium (He, 2) is the lightest noble gas and the second most abundant element in the Universe (after hydrogen). Discovered by Sir William Ramsey, Pierre Janssen, and Norman Lockyer, it has two stable isotopes, helium-3 and helium-4, with helium-4 by far the more common. Because of their different quantum properties (the helium-3 nucleus is a fermion, while the helium-4 nucleus is a boson), the isotopes of helium actually have significantly different physical properties. Helium-4 can exist in a zero-viscosity state known as superfluidity when its temperature drops below the lambda point. Helium has the lowest boiling point of any element; liquid helium is used for devices that need intense cooling, such as MRI machines. Most helium on Earth results from radioactive decay, since the helium nucleus is equivalent to an alpha particle.\n\nOxygen (O, 8) is, by mass, the most common element in Earth’s crust. It was discovered independently by Carl Scheele and Joseph Priestley; Priestley originally called it “dephlogisticated air.” Oxygen normally exists in elemental form as a diatomic gas (O2), but it can also exist in a triatomic form, ozone (O3), which is known for its role in blocking UV rays in Earth’s stratosphere. Diatomic oxygen is — despite having an even number of electrons — paramagnetic, meaning it has unpaired electrons. This points out a problem with traditional valence bond theories, which predict that oxygen should be diamagnetic; molecular orbital theory correctly explains this behavior. Because oxygen is easily capable of accepting electrons, reactions in which a species gives up electrons are known as oxidation reactions.\n\nNitrogen (N, 7) is the most abundant element in Earth’s atmosphere. Nitrogen, which was first isolated as “noxious air” by Daniel Rutherford, exists primarily as a diatomic molecule containing two triple-bonded nitrogen atoms (N2). Because nitrogen gas is extremely stable, N2 is unusable for many biological and chemical purposes. To make it useful, it often undergoes fixation to convert it into usable nitrogen species such as the ammonium ion (NH4+) — as it is by bacteria in the root nodules of legume plants—or ammonia gas (NH3), as is done industrially in the Haber-Bosch process. Conversely, its stability makes it useful in preventing unwanted combustion reactions. It also has a relatively low boiling point (–196°C), which makes liquid nitrogen useful as a refrigerant.\n\nMercury (Hg, 80) is one of just two elements that is a liquid at standard temperature and pressure (the only other one is bromine). It has been known since antiquity, and is found in ores such as cinnabar. Older names for it, reflecting its liquid nature, include hydrargyrum (the source of its symbol) and quicksilver. Because it is a very dense liquid, it is commonly used in barometers to measure atmospheric pressure; the pressure exerted by the atmosphere equals the pressure exerted by a column containing 760 millimeters of mercury. Alloys of mercury with other metals are called amalgams, some of which have been used as dental fillings. Chronic exposure to mercury can cause psychological problems; its use in hatmaking led to the expression “mad as a hatter.” More recently, concerns about mercury exposure have led to the banning of mercury in thermometers.\n\nSulfur (S, 16) was widely known in the ancient world, and is referred to in the Bible as brimstone. Its nature as an element was first recognized by Antoine Lavoisier. Its most stable allotrope is an eight-membered ring that exists as a yellow solid. It is most often isolated by injecting superheated steam into the ground in the Frasch process. As an element, it is used in the vulcanization process to cross-link the polymer strands of rubber to increase strength; similarly, sulfur-sulfur bonds hold many proteins together. Industrially, though, the majority of sulfur is used to make sulfuric acid, H2SO4 (in fact, sulfuric acid is the most widely produced chemical in the chemical industry). Sulfur compounds are noted for their strong and unpleasant odors; small quantities of hydrogen sulfide, H2S, are frequently added to natural gas — which is normally odorless — to help people notice gas leaks.\n\nIron (Fe, 26) is the most common metal in the Earth, and one of the major components of the Earth’s core. Iron was known to the ancients; its atomic symbol comes from the Latin name ferrum. Iron is the namesake of ferromagnetism; one of its ores is magnetite, Fe3O4, which contains iron in both of its most common oxidation states, 2+ and 3+. Iron(II) sulfide, FeS2, is formally known as pyrite, but because of its appearance has long been known as fool’s gold. Iron can react with oxygen in the air to form iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3, in a relatively slow but exothermic process; this process is used in “all-day” heat patches. Hydrated iron(III) oxide is better known as rust; rust only forms when iron is exposed to both oxygen and water. Its isotope 56 is one of the most strongly bound of all nuclei, with the lowest mass per nucleon. Iron is one of the heaviest elements that is normally produced by stellar nucleosynthesis. The largest use of iron is in steel.\n\nCarbon (C, 6) is found, by definition, in all organic compounds. It is the fourth most abundant element in the Universe. It has three major isotopes: isotope 12, which is stable; isotope 13, which is used in NMR spectroscopy; and isotope 14, which is radioactive and is the basis of carbon dating. Carbon’s ability to form four chemical bonds means that it has many different allotropes. The best-characterized natural allotropes are diamond, which consists of a tetrahedral network of carbon atoms, and graphite, which consists of planes of carbon atoms arranged in hexagons. Fullerenes such as buckyballs and carbon nanotubes, on the other hand, are generally produced synthetically; buckyballs are roughly spherical. More recently, graphene, which is a single layer of atoms shaped like graphite, has proven to have remarkable properties; for example, it is nearly transparent while being about 200 times stronger than an equivalent mass of steel.\n\nAluminum (Al, 13) is the most common metal in Earth’s crust, and the first metal in the p block of elements. First isolated by Hans Christian Ørsted, its primary ore is bauxite, from which it is refined using large amounts of electric current, via electrolysis, through the Bayer and Hall-Héroult processes. (Because aluminum exists only in a +3 oxidation state, it takes three moles of electrons to produce one mole of aluminum; as a result, it has been estimated that 5% of all electricity in the U.S. goes to purifying aluminum.) It is found in the mineral corundum, which is found in many gems, including sapphires and rubies; the specific impurities found in a gem determine its color. It is also found in aluminosilicates, such as feldspar.\n\nGold (Au, 79) was known to the ancients as a relatively inert metal. Its atomic symbol comes from its Latin name, aurum. It is resistant to attack by most acids, but it (along with platinum) will dissolve in aqua regia, a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. Among all metals, it has the highest electronegativity and electron affinity; it occasionally is found in a –1 oxidation state as Au–. Widely used in jewelry, it also has a number of scientific uses. Ernest Rutherford’s gold foil experiment demonstrated the existence of a positively charged nucleus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) often requires that specimens be “sputtered,” or thinly coated, with gold atoms to allow imaging. Suspensions of gold compounds have been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis."

    "title": "Works By Mozart",
    "content": "Piano Sonatas: One of Mozart’s best-known pieces is the “Rondo Alla Turca” from his Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331. That sonata begins with a theme and variations that inspired Max Reger to write his Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Mozart. Sonata No. 14 in C minor, K. 457, is often performed with the highly chromatic Fantasy, K. 475. Other notable Mozart piano sonatas include the dramatic No. 8 in A minor, K. 310; the Sonata “for beginners” No. 16 in C major, K. 545; and the “Hunt” or “Trumpet” Sonata No. 18 in D, K. 576, his last. Mozart also finished four sonatas for piano duet (also known as “piano four hands”) and one in D major for two pianos.\n\nPiano Concertos: Mozart’s piano concertos are numbered from 1–27, though six of them are arrangements of works by other composers. The Concerto No. 8 in C major, K. 246, is named for Countess Lützow, for whom it was written, and No. 9 in E flat major, K. 271, is nicknamed “Jeunehomme” (although recent scholarship suggests the title should actually be “Jenamy,” after an acquaintance of Mozart named Victoire Jenamy). The first movement of the Jeunehomme” Concerto unusually (for the time) has the soloist start playing very early—in the second measure—and its last movement Rondo includes a slow minuet section. The Concerto No. 21 in C, K. 467, is often nicknamed “Elvira Madigan” because it was used in the 1967 Swedish film of that name. No. 26 in D, K. 537, is called the “Coronation,” because it was played at the coronation of Leopold II. Mozart also wrote concertos for two pianos (No. 10 in E flat major, K. 365) and three pianos (No. 7 in F major, K. 242, nicknamed “Lodron”).\n\nString Quartets: Mozart, like most composers of his day, wrote most of his quartets in sets of three or six; he also wrote two standalone quartets for a total of 23. The most famous are probably the six “Haydn” Quartets (Nos. 14–19). The collection begins with the highly chromatic Spring Quartet in G major, K. 387, and ends with the even more chromatic Dissonant Quartet in C major, K. 465, which begins with an extremely dissonant Adagio introduction. The Haydn Quartets also include the Hunt Quartet, No. 17 in B flat major, K. 458, so named for its “hunting-horn” melodies. The other famous collection of Mozart quartets is the set of three Prussian Quartets (Nos. 21–23), dedicated to Friedrich Wilhelm II, which make prominent use of the cello. Between these two sets, Mozart wrote the Hoffmeister Quartet, No. 20 in D major, K. 499, for his friend Anton Hoffmeister.\n\nSerenades and Divertimentos: These include two of Mozart’s most familiar pieces, Eine kleine Nachtmusik, K. 525, and A Musical Joke, K. 522. Eine kleine Nachtmusik, originally scored for string quartet and double bass, is often translated as “a little night music” (but more accurately as “a little serenade”); it includes a lovely “Romanze” second movement as well as the more famous first movement. A Musical Joke is exactly that: a parody of bad composition, ending with chords in four different keys, and including almost every possible kind of “mistake.” Mozart’s other Serenades include the “Gran Partita” for 13 instruments (No. 10 in B flat major, K. 361), as well as the “Posthorn” and “Haffner” (not to be confused with the symphony!).\n\nLast Three Symphonies: Mozart wrote Symphonies Nos. 39–41 in about three months in the summer of 1788, for unknown reasons. (It is unclear if any of them were performed in his lifetime, although No. 40 probably was.) Of the three, only No. 39 in E flat major, K. 543, has a slow introduction; unusually, it omits oboes entirely. No. 40 in G minor, K. 550, on the other hand, was revised to reduce the oboe part and add clarinets; the last movement may have inspired the third movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. No. 41 in C major, K. 551, probably got its nickname of “Jupiter” from Johann Peter Salomon. Its first movement quotes Mozart’s aria “Un bacio di mano” (“A kiss on her hand”), composed for Pasquale Anfossi’s opera Il curioso indiscreto; its last movement presents five themes which are all brought together in a massive fugato at the end.\n\nOther symphonies: Of Mozart’s first 38 symphonies, the “Little” G minor symphony (No. 25, K. 183) is the only one in a minor key. The “Paris” Symphony (No. 31 in D major, K. 297), written for that city, begins with a fast upward D major scale that can be classified as a “Mannheim rocket,” a popular opening device for symphonies. Mozart’s other notable symphonies include the “Haffner” (No. 35 in D major, K. 385), which is more familiar than the serenade; the Linz Symphony (No. 36 in C major, K. 425); and the Prague Symphony (No. 38 in D major, K. 504). There is no Symphony No. 37: Mozart added an introduction to a symphony by Michael Haydn (Joseph’s brother) and scholars did not notice that the rest of the work was not by Mozart until 1907.\n\nThe Abduction from the Seraglio (Die Entführung aus dem Serail, K. 384): While often called an opera, The Abduction from the Seraglio, is, like The Magic Flute, actually a Singspiel with spoken dialogue (as opposed to sung recitatives). The action takes place at the home of the Ottoman Pasha Selim, and the music uses “Janissary” military instruments associated with “Turkish” music. Belmonte is trying to rescue his lover Konstanze from the Seraglio (harem); he is assisted by Pedrillo, his servant, while Osmin works for the Pasha. In the end, the Pasha releases Belmonte and Konstanze, much to Osmin’s chagrin. Famous arias include Osmin’s “O, wie will ich triumphieren” and Konstanze’s incredibly difficult “Martern aller Arten.” According to one story, Joseph II accused it of having “too many notes.”\n\nCosì fan tutte (roughly, They’re All Like That, K. 588): This opera is, along with The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni, one of Mozart’s collaborations with Italian librettist Lorenzo da Ponte. The soldiers Guglielmo and Ferrando, who love the sisters Fiordiligi and Dorabella, respectively, brag about the fidelity of their fiancées; in a coffeeshop, Don Alfonso makes a bet that he can make the sisters fall in love with other men in one day. Don Alfonso disguises the two men as Albanians after bribing the sisters’ maid Despina; at first they resist (see Fiordiligi’s aria “Come Scoglio”), but after Dorabella and Guglielmo trade a medallion and a heart-shaped locket, Fiordiligi is seduced by Ferrando. In the end, the sisters “almost” marry the wrong husbands, and only realize they’ve been tricked when the two men return to the stage half in disguise, half out.\n\nThe Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte, K. 620): The libretto, by Emanuel Schikaneder, who took the role of Papageno at the premier, incorporates many Masonic elements (both Schikaneder and Mozart were Masons). Tamino is saved from a serpent by three maidens of the Queen of the Night, but Papageno, a bird-catcher, claims credit. Both are shown their counterparts — Pamina and Papagena — but must face several trials at the hands of the sorcerer Sarastro, who heads a cult of Isis and Osiris and is assisted by Monostatos, a treacherous Moor. The Queen of the Night, who has two very difficult arias (“O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn” and “Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen,” the latter of which is often just called “the Queen of the Night’s aria”), attempts to stop Tamino and Pamina from joining Sarastro, but is magically exiled with Monostatos.\n\nRequiem: Mozart’s Requiem, K. 626, was his last composition; it was anonymously commissioned by the Count von Walsegg. Mozart died before he could finish it; many musicians have completed it, including Mozart’s student Franz Xaver Süssmayr, and more recently Richard Maunder and Robert Levin. The scoring is notably for low-timbered instruments, omitting oboes and flutes and substituting basset horns for clarinets. The theme of the “Kyrie” was taken from “And With His Stripes We Are Healed,” a chorus from Handel’s Messiah. After the dramatic “Dies Irae,” the “Tuba Mirum” begins with a trombone solo. The circumstances surrounding Mozart’s death remain mysterious, and the (unfounded) rumor that Antonio Salieri murdered him gave rise to the Aleksandr Pushkin play Mozart and Salieri, which in turn inspired a Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov opera and Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus, which became an Academy Award-winning film."

    "title": "Ancient Greek Plays",
    "content": "The Frogs (Aristophanes, c. 405 BC) This comedy centers on the god Dionysus, who journeys to the underworld with his much smarter slave, Xanthias. Dionysus is unhappy with the low quality of contemporary theater, and plans to bring the playwright Euripides back from the dead. As the ferryman Charon rows Dionysus to the underworld (Xanthias is forced to walk), a chorus of the title creatures appears and repeatedly chants the phrase “Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.” Dionysus and Xanthias then have a series of misadventures, during which they alternately claim to be Heracles. Finally, the two find Euripides arguing with the playwright Aeschylus as to which is the better author. After the dramatists “weigh” their verses on a scale, and offer advice on how to save the city of Athens, Dionysus judges that it is Aeschylus who should be brought back to life.\n\nThe Birds (Aristophanes, c. 414 BC) At the start of this comedy, two Athenians named Peisthetaerus and Euelpides seek out Tereus, a human king who was transformed into a bird called a hoopoe (some translations refer to Tereus as “Epops,” the Greek word for “hoopoe”). Peisthetaerus convinces Tereus and his fellow birds to build a city in the sky, which would allow the birds to demand sacrifices from humans, and to blockade the Olympian gods. Peisthetaerus and Euelpides eat a root that gives them wings, and aid the birds in the construction of the city Nephelokokkygia, or “Cloudcuckooland.” Peisthetaerus also drives away objectionable visitors, such as a poet, an oracle-monger, and a dealer in decrees. After the messenger goddess Iris is found in the city, the residents of Cloudcuckooland demand concessions from the Olympians. On the advice of Prometheus, Peisthetaerus demands that Zeus give up his mistress Basileia, or Sovereignty, from whom “all things come.” Peisthetaerus marries Basileia, and is crowned king.\n\nThe Clouds (Aristophanes, c. 423 BC) This comedy lampoons Athenian philosophers, especially Socrates and his Sophist followers, whose insubstantial, obfuscating arguments are inspired by the title goddesses. The protagonist, Strepsiades, fears that his horse-obsessed son, Pheidippides, is spending too much money. Consequently, Strepsiades wants Pheidippides to enroll in the Phrontisterion, or “Thinkery” of Socrates to learn specious arguments that can be used to avoid paying debts. Pheidippides refuses, so Strepsiades enrolls in the Thinkery himself. There, Strepsiades learns about new discoveries, such as a technique to measure how far a flea can jump. Eventually Pheidippides is also pressured into studying at the Thinkery, where he and Strepsiades are instructed by the beings Just and Unjust Discourse. Strepsiades believes that the education will enable Pheidippides to foil all creditors, but Pheidippides instead uses his new-found debating skills to justify beating up his father. In response, Strepsiades leads a mob to destroy the Thinkery.\n\nLysistrata (Aristophanes, c. 411 BC) The title character of this comedy is an Athenian woman who decides to end the Peloponnesian War, which was still ongoing when the play premiered in 411 BC. At the beginning of the play, Lysistrata assembles a secret “Council of Women,” whose members represent many different regions of Greece. Once the women have gathered, Lysistrata reveals her proposal: all Greek women should abstain from having sex until the men agree to stop fighting. Although Lysistrata’s plan draws protests from her bawdy neighbor Calonice, and from the amorous wife Myrrhine, the Spartan Lampito reluctantly supports the idea, and helps to convince the other women. As Athenian women capture the Acropolis, the female representatives from other regions return home to enlist their compatriots in the plan. The ensuing events include conflicts between a chorus of old women and a chorus of old men, and a personal plea to Myrrhine from her husband, Cinesias. Both genders suffer from sexual deprivation, but the women of Greece remain united. With the aid of a beautiful girl called Diallage, or Reconciliation, Lysistrata convinces the frenzied men to agree to an equitable peace.\n\nOedipus Rex (Sophocles, c. 429 BC, also known by its translated title Oedipus the King) This tragedy tells the story of Oedipus, a man who became king of Thebes by defeating a monster called the sphinx. After a mysterious plague devastates Thebes, Oedipus sends his brother-in-law Creon to ask the Oracle at Delphi about the cause of the affliction. The Oracle attributes the plague to the fact that the murderer of Laius, the previous king of Thebes, has never been caught and punished. Oedipus then seeks information from the prophet Teiresias, who is provoked into revealing that Oedipus himself was the killer. Oedipus initially rejects this claim, but begins to have doubts after talking with his wife Jocasta, who was once married to Laius. Jocasta recalls a prophecy that Laius would be killed by his own son, but she claims that this prophecy did not come true, because Laius was murdered by highwaymen. This leads Oedipus to recall killing a man who resembled Laius, and a prophecy which had claimed that Oedipus would kill his own father, and marry his own mother. A shepherd from Mount Cithaeron reveals the awful truth: in response to the prophecy about their son, Laius and Jocasta had tried to expose the infant Oedipus in the wilderness. However, the shepherd had taken pity on the child, and sent him away to be raised in another area. Not knowing his true heritage, Oedipus eventually left home to avoid harming the people whom he believed to be his parents, but unknowingly fulfilled the prophecy by killing Laius and marrying Jocasta. Upon learning this, Jocasta commits suicide, and Oedipus blinds himself with Jocasta’s brooches. Creon assumes control of Thebes as Oedipus begs to be exiled along with his daughters, Ismene and Antigone.\n\nAntigone (Sophocles, c. 441 BC) Along with Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus, Antigone is one of the three surviving “Theban plays” by Sophocles that center on the family of Oedipus. The tragedy takes place in the immediate aftermath of a battle in which Oedipus’s two sons, Polyneices and Eteocles, killed each other while struggling to control Thebes. The current ruler of the city, Creon, has declared that Eteocles will be given an honorable funeral, but Polyneices will be treated as a rebel and left unburied. Oedipus’s daughter Antigone disobeys Creon’s order, and buries her brother Polyneices against the advice of her frightened sister, Ismene. Despite the intervention of Creon’s son Haemon, who is betrothed to Antigone, Creon sentences Antigone to be entombed alive. Soon after she is imprisoned, Antigone hangs herself. Haemon then commits suicide out of grief, and Creon’s wife Eurydice kills herself when she learns that Haemon is dead. The once-proud Creon blames himself for the loss of his wife and son, and prays for death.\n\nSeven Against Thebes (Aeschylus, c. 467 BC) This early Greek tragedy tells the story of Oedipus’s two sons, Polyneices and Eteocles, who initially agreed to rule Thebes together before Eteocles seized the kingship for himself. Most of the play consists of a conversation between Eteocles, the chorus, and a spy who describes the seven captains who have arrived to besiege the seven gates of Thebes. After each man is described, Eteocles selects the warrior who will face that attacker. When the seventh attacker is revealed to be Polyneices, Eteocles sets off to confront his brother. At the conclusion of the play, it is announced that although Eteocles’s forces have turned back the invaders, the brothers have slain each other. Antigone, the sister of Eteocles and Polyneices, vows to defy the laws of Thebes by giving Polyneices a proper burial.\n\nMedea (Euripides, c. 431 BC) This Euripides play retells the myth of Medea, a sorceress from Colchis who saved Jason and the Argonauts during their quest for the Golden Fleece. Set after the Argonauts’ quest, the play depicts Medea’s vengeance against Jason as he prepares to marry the Corinthian princess Glauce. Medea uses poisoned robes to kill Glauce and Glauce’s father Creon (a different character than the Creon who appears in Sophocles’s Theban plays). Not content with this, Medea seeks to hurt Jason further by killing the sons that she bore him. When Jason tries to confront Medea, she appears above the stage in a chariot pulled by dragons, and exchanges bitter words with her former lover before departing to seek refuge with King Aegeus of Athens. The play’s ending is a classic example of a deus ex machina, a literary device in which plot problems are suddenly resolved by an unexpected contrivance.\n\nThe Bacchae (Euripides, c. 405 BC) At the start of this tragedy, the god Dionysus arrives in Thebes to seek vengeance against his aunt Agave, who has denied his immortality, and her son Pentheus, who as King of Thebes bans the worship of Dionysus. The god first drives the women of the city mad, causing them to act as wild Maenads. He then convinces Pentheus to disguise himself in animal skins, and spy on the maddened women. However, the demented Agave mistakes Pentheus for a mountain lion, and dismembers her own son. The climax of the play occurs when Agave presents the head of Pentheus to her horrified father, Cadmus. As Agave realizes what she has done, Dionysus chastises her for her lack of respect, and foretells how Cadmus will spend his final days.\n\nOresteia (Aeschylus, c. 458 BC) Originally a four-play cycle, only three works (Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides) survive; a “satyr play” entitled Proteus has been lost. Agamemnon, the first play in the trilogy, describes the murder of Agamemnon and his concubine Cassandra by Agamemnon’s adulterous wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus. The Libation Bearers continues the story, describing how Agamemnon’s children, Orestes and Electra, avenge their father by murdering Aegisthus and Clytemnestra. However, the Furies relentlessly pursue Orestes for his matricide, leading to the events of The Eumenides. In this third play, Orestes appeals to Athena, who organizes a trial for him (with Apollo as a defense counsel). Ultimately, when Apollo argues that the man is more important than the woman in a marriage, Orestes is acquitted, and the Furies are renamed the Eumenides, or “The Kindly Ones.” The cycle has been retold numerous times in modern literature, notably by Eugene O’Neill in Mourning Becomes Electra and by Jean-Paul Sartre in The Flies."

    "title": "Greek Mythological Monsters",
    "content": "Typhon (also Typhoeus or Typhaon) and Echidna are known as the Father and Mother of All Monsters due to their numerous monstrous offspring, including the two-headed dog Orthrus, the Nemean Lion, the Hydra, the Chimera, and Cerberus. Typhon was the last son of Gaea and Tartarus, while Echidna’s parentage is obscured by ancient sources; most often, she is listed as a daughter of Phorcys and Ceto. In the Theogony, Hesiod describes a climactic battle between Zeus and Typhon following Zeus’ defeat of the Titans: Typhon rips out Zeus’ sinews and is nearly victorious, but Hermes restores Zeus’s sinews and Zeus finally overpowers the giant monster. Typhon was then trapped under Mount Etna, where he is believed to cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nPolyphemus, the most famous Cyclops in Greek mythology, is the son of Poseidon and the sea nymph Thoosa. The most notable myth involving Polyphemus is his appearance in Book IX of Homer’s Odyssey: after Odysseus and his crew land on Polyphemus’ island after escaping the Lotus-Eaters, Polyphemus eats two of Odysseus’ crew, imprisons the rest in his cave, and eats four more before the survivors can escape. To escape, Odysseus gets Polyphemus drunk on wine and blinds the one-eyed giant with a stick; the next morning, Odysseus and his crew ride out of Polyphemus’ cave, hiding underneath the Cyclops’ sheep. When Polyphemus asks Odysseus’ name, Odysseus responds “No one” or “No man” (translations vary), and Polyphemus prays to his father Poseidon to make Odysseus’ journey home treacherous. In another myth, Polyphemus falls in love with the nymph Galatea, who in turn loves the human Acis. Polyphemus then kills Acis with a boulder out of jealousy.\n\nMedusa is the only mortal member of the Gorgons, a trio of monstrous daughters of Phorcys and Ceto who had brass hands, fangs, and venomous snakes for hair; the other two were Stheno and Euryale. Many early sources state that Medusa was born a monster, though Ovid’s Metamorphoses state that Medusa was a beautiful woman until she was raped by Poseidon in Athena’s temple and cursed by the goddess. Gazing directly into Medusa’s eyes resulted in the onlooker being turned into stone. She was beheaded by the hero Perseus, who was sent to retrieve her head by the tyrant Polydectes, whom Perseus then killed with the head. Perseus gave the head of Medusa to Athena, who placed it on her shield, the aegis. When Medusa was beheaded, the winged horse Pegasus and the giant warrior Chrysaor emerged, her sons by Poseidon. According to Ovid, Medusa’s head was also used to petrify the Titan Atlas.\n\nThe Minotaur (also Asterion) was a half-man, half-bull monster kept in the Labyrinth on Crete by King Minos. Minos prayed to Poseidon to send a snow-white bull as a sign of support during Minos’ quarrel with his brothers for the throne of Crete, but instead of sacrificing the animal to the sea god, Minos kept it for himself. Angered, Poseidon caused Minos’ wife Pasiphaë to lust after the bull, so Daedalus built her a wooden cow so she could mate with the bull. The product of this encounter was the Minotaur (lit. “Bull of Minos”). After Minos’ son Androgeus was killed by Athenians, Minos demanded seven Athenians male youths and seven Athenian female youths, to be selected by lots every seven or nine years (accounts vary) as retribution; these victims were fed to the Minotaur. On the third drawing of the lots, the Athenian hero Theseus volunteered to vanquish the beast; with the help of Minos’ daughter Ariadne, who gave Theseus a ball of string so he could find his way out of the Labyrinth, Theseus slew the Minotaur. On the return voyage from Crete, Theseus forgot to change his sails from black back to white, and his father Aegeus jumped into the sea, believing his son had died.\n\nThe Lernaean Hydra was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna. The Hydra was a multi-headed water serpent that breathed poisonous gas and had toxic blood, and every time one head was cut off, two more grew back in its place. The Hydra dwelled in the Spring of Amymone in the swamp or lake of Lerna near the Peloponnese, beneath which was said to be an entrance to the Underworld. The Hydra was killed by Heracles as his second labor for Eurystheus during a battle in which Heracles’ nephew Iolaus provided aid by cauterizing the neck stumps after Heracles cut each head off, preventing additional heads from growing back. After killing the monster, Heracles dipped his arrows in the Hydra’s blood; the poisoned arrows were later used against the Stymphalian Birds, Geryon, and the centaur Nessus.\n\nCerberus was the three-headed (or, according to Hesiod’s Theogony, 50-headed) dog who guarded the gates to the Underworld. A child of Typhon and Echidna, Cerberus is described as a hellhound with a mane of snakes, the claws of a lion, and the tail of a deadly snake. As Heracles’ twelfth and final labor, he had to bring Cerberus back from the Underworld, which he did following an intense wrestling match. Prior to the task, Heracles was instructed in the Eleusinian Mysteries, and freed Theseus from being stuck on a chair in Hades. In Virgil’s Aeneid, the Cumaean Sibyl gives Cerberus three drugged honeycakes so that she and Aeneas can enter the Underworld.\n\nThe Chimera was a hybrid monster who was also a child of Typhon and Echidna. She is most commonly described as a lioness with a goat’s head protruding from her back and a tail that ended in a snake’s head. She was a fire-breathing menace to Lycia until Bellerophon slew her on orders from King Iobates. Flying on the back of Pegasus, Bellerophon shot at the Chimera and ultimately killed the beast by affixing a block of lead to his spear and causing the Chimera to melt the block with her fiery breath, suffocating her in the process.\n\nThe Sphinx, identified in the Theogony as “Phix,” was a hybrid monster whose parentage varies widely from source to source. She was a lion-bodied, winged monster with the face of a human, who terrorized the city of Thebes in the generations before Oedipus. She would give a riddle — “What creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?” — and eat anyone who was unable to answer correctly. It is possible that the Sphinx was sent to Thebes from Ethiopia by either the goddess Hera or the war god Ares. Eventually, Oedipus correctly answered the riddle— “Man” — and the Sphinx threw herself off her mountainside perch to her death.\n\nThe Sirens were beautiful women who appeared harmless and sang a beautiful song to passing sailors, only to prove vicious and bloodthirsty when the sailors ventured too close. The Greeks often said that the Sirens were the daughters of the river god Achelous, while the Romans named their father as Phorcys. In the Argonautica, Chiron warns Jason that Orpheus will be instrumental on his journey, and Orpheus later saves all of Jason’s crew (save Butes) by playing his lyre when they pass the Sirens to drown out their beautiful and alluring song. Odysseus also encountered the Sirens, tying himself to the mast of his ship so that he could safely hear their song while his crew plugged their ears with beeswax, on the advice of the sorceress Circe.\n\nThe Calydonian Boar was a monstrous beast sent by Artemis to wreak havoc in Calydon after King Oeneus neglected to honor her while sacrificing to the gods. Oeneus’s son Meleager led a group of heroes — including Theseus, the twins Castor and Polydeuces (or Pollux), and Achilles’s father Peleus, as well as the huntress Atalanta — on what became known as the Calydonian Boar Hunt. Atalanta drew first blood, and Meleager finished off the beast. Meleager, who had fallen in love with Atalanta, then insisted on honoring her by giving her the hide. Meleager’s uncles protested, Meleager killed them, and Meleager’s mother avenged the death of her brothers by burning up the log that represented Meleager’s lifespan, killing him."

    "title": "American Composers",
    "content": "George Gershwin’s (1898–1937) music blended classical traditions and genres with jazz and popular idioms. His “Rhapsody in Blue” (1924) and “Concerto in F” (1925) both feature solo piano and orchestra, while “An American in Paris” (1928) and “Cuban Overture” (1932) were inspired by his trips abroad. The lyrics for his vocal works were often written by his brother Ira; two of his best-known songs, “Embraceable You” and “I Got Rhythm,” appeared in his Broadway musical Girl Crazy (1930). His opera Porgy and Bess (1935), which included the song standards “Summertime” and “It Ain’t Necessarily So,” featured an entirely African-American cast.\n\nAaron Copland (1900–1990) was one of a litany of American composers who studied in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, for whom Copland wrote the solo keyboard part in his Symphony for Organ and Orchestra (1924; revised as Symphony No. 1 in 1928). “El Salón México” (1936) was the first of his highly successful “Populist” works based on folk or folk-like themes, which also included his three major ballets: Billy the Kid (1938), Rodeo (1942), and Appalachian Spring (1944). His opera The Tender Land (1954) included the chorus “The Promise of Living.” Copland utilized modified serial techniques in his later works; he composed very little in his last 25 years.\n\nLeonard Bernstein (1918–1990) was a prolific composer and conductor who gave numerous televised “Young People’s Concerts” during his eleven-year tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic (1958–1969). His concert works include his Symphony No. 1, “Jeremiah” (1942), and a jazz clarinet concerto premiered by Benny Goodman: “Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs” (1949). Bernstein is best known for his works for the stage, which include the musical West Side Story (1957), the ballet Fancy Free (1944), and the operetta Candide (1956; revised 1989). He also composed the score for the 1954 film On the Waterfront.\n\nArnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) was an Austrian composer who emigrated to the U.S. in 1934. Schoenberg was the leading figure and mentor of the “Second Viennese School,” which also included Alban Berg and Anton Webern, who were Schoenberg’s students. In 1908, Schoenberg began composing atonal music, which has no tonic pitch or key center. He also developed the twelve-tone method of composition, one of the most influential musical styles of the 20th century and first fully realized in his Suite for Piano, Op. 25 (1923). His other musical innovations include the technique of klangfarbenmelodie (“tone-color melody”), which was used in the third movement of his Five Pieces for Orchestra (1909).\n\nPhilip Glass (1937–present) was a minimalist composer who is best known for his trilogy of “Portrait Operas,” which include Einstein on the Beach (1976), Satyagraha (1979), and Akhnaten (1983). Einstein on the Beach is particularly notable for its use of solfege syllables and numbers in place of a standard libretto. Glass’s style is heavily influenced by Indian musical traditions, and focuses on additive processes; this focus can be seen in his early minimal works “Strung Out” (1967) and “Music in Fifths” (1969). Glass is a prolific composer of film scores; his most prominent include his scores for The Truman Show, The Hours, and Notes on a Scandal.\n\nSamuel Barber (1910–1981) was a classicist composer best known for his “Adagio for Strings” (1936), which he adapted from his String Quartet, and which was premiered under the baton of the legendary conductor Arturo Toscanini. Other major orchestral works include his Piano Concerto (1962), his ballet score Cave of the Heart (1947) based on the Greek tale of Medea, and his single-movement “First Symphony” (1936, revised 1943). His vocal works include “Dover Beach” (1931) and “Knoxville: Summer of 1915” (1947). For much of Barber’s life, he maintained a romantic relationship with the opera composer Gian-Carlo Menotti. His first opera, Vanessa (1958), won the Pulitzer Prize; his second major opera, Antony and Cleopatra (1966), was a flop.\n\nCharles Ives (1874–1954) was a modernist, experimental composer whose programmatic works often utilize polytonality (more than one active key center at a time), quote extensively from folk songs and earlier classical works, and have distinctly “American” themes. Ives, who worked in the insurance industry, was not widely-recognized as a composer until late in his life. His Piano Sonata No. 2 (1915), the “Concord” sonata, depicts four leading figures of the transcendentalist movement. His Symphony No. 3, “The Camp Meeting” (1947), was awarded the 1947 Pulitzer Prize. Other notable works include the suite Three Places in New England (1914) and “The Unanswered Question” (1906).\n\nJohn Cage (1912–1992) was an experimentalist composer whose works are known for aleatoric (chance-based) composition and other forms of indeterminacy. His best-known piece, 4′33″ (1952), is created from the ambient sounds of the concert space while the performer(s) sits silently on stage. His Music of Changes (1951), as well as numerous other works, were written utilizing the Chinese I Ching to determine musical content. Cage’s other innovations include works for “prepared piano,” a piano which has had various objects inserted into its strings. A 639-year-long organ performance of his “As Slow As Possible” (1987) is currently underway in Germany, having begun in 2001.\n\nJohn (Coolidge) Adams (1947–present) was a minimalist composer whose music, like that of Charles Ives, often features an “American” program. Adams may be best known for his opera Nixon in China (1987), which dramatizes the 1972 presidential visit and meeting with Mao. His other operas include Doctor Atomic (2005), which is about the Manhattan Project. He composed “On the Transmigration of Souls” (2002) to memorialize the September 11th attacks; that work received the Pulitzer Prize. Other major works for orchestra include Harmonium (1980), Harmonielehre (1985), Shaker Loops (1978), and his Violin Concerto (1993).\n\nStephen Sondheim (1930–2021) was one of the most celebrated lyricists and composers in musical theater. Sondheim’s career included eight Tony Awards. He was mentored by Oscar Hammerstein II (of Rodgers and Hammerstein), and was the lyricist for West Side Story, working alongside composer Leonard Bernstein. Musicals for which he was both lyricist and composer include Company (1970), a series of scenes about an unmarried bachelor and his married friends; Sweeney Todd (1979), about a barber’s murderous quest for revenge; Into the Woods (1987), a dark mash-up of several fairy tales; and Sunday in the Park with George (1984), which portrays a fictionalized version of the painter Georges Seurat and won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama."

    "title": "Authors Of Speculative Fiction",
    "content": "Mary Shelley (1797–1851, United Kingdom). As the daughter of the philosophers William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft (the author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman), and the wife of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley was a product of both the Enlightenment and Romantic eras. Her 1818 novel Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus helped to lay the groundwork for modern science fiction by contrasting Enlightenment ideas of progress with a Romantic conception of nature as an untameable force. The idea for Frankenstein came to Shelley while she was taking part in a friendly writing competition at Lord Byron’s villa on Lake Geneva. Inspired by Luigi Galvani’s experiments in “animal electricity,” Shelley wrote about the Swiss scientist Victor Frankenstein, who reanimates dead tissue and creates a “monster.” This attempt to control nature fails, as the monster murders Frankenstein’s brother William, friend Henry Clerval, and wife Elizabeth before fleeing to the Arctic. Frankenstein pursues his creation, and tells his story to the explorer Robert Walton before dying. Shelley presented an even bleaker scenario in her 1826 novel The Last Man, which describes Lionel Verney’s efforts to survive a 21st-century plague that devastates human civilization.\n\nJules Verne (1828–1905, France). Verne offered a brighter vision of technological progress in his novels of adventure, many of which doubled as works of popular science. In Verne’s 1864 novel Journey to the Center of the Earth, Professor Lidenbrock explains contemporary theories of geology and paleontology as he leads an expedition that travels beneath the Earth’s crust from Iceland to the Italian volcano Stromboli. Verne later wrote the 1870 novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, whose narrator Pierre Aronnax offers extensive commentary on marine biology while accompanying the mysterious Captain Nemo on a voyage in the submarine Nautilus. In a more realistic vein, Verne considered the possibilities presented by new forms of transportation in the 1873 novel Around the World in Eighty Days, which describes a trip taken by the Englishman Phileas Fogg and his French valet Jean Passepartout. During his travels, which are undertaken to win a bet with members of the Reform Club, Fogg falls in love with an Indian woman named Aouda, and is pursued by the Scotland Yard detective Fix, who mistakenly believes that Fogg is a bank robber. Fogg ultimately wins his bet to return to the Reform Club within 80 days of his departure, with the help of an extra day gained by traveling eastward.\n\nHerbert George Wells (1866–1946, United Kingdom). H. G. Wells used speculative fiction to explore the social issues of his day from a left-wing perspective. In the 1895 novella The Time Machine, Wells wrote about a “Time Traveller” who visits the year AD 802,701, and learns that humanity has diverged into two different species—the surface-dwelling Eloi, who are gentle and beautiful but intellectually limited, and the subterranean Morlocks, who resemble apes but are strong and clever enough to use the Eloi as livestock. The Time Traveller speculates that the Eloi are descended from aristocrats who were once served by the ancestors of the Morlocks. After writing about time travel, Wells helped to establish another of science fiction’s key themes by depicting an alien invasion in the 1897 novel The War of the Worlds. The anonymous narrator of The War of the Worlds observes a Martian spaceship that lands in Surrey, and flees the “Tripods” and “Black Smoke” that the Martians use as weapons in the conquest of Earth. The invaders easily overcome human resistance, but eventually perish from lack of immunity to Earth microbes. Wells also wrote several novels about researchers who use science to pursue unethical goals. In the 1896 Wells novel The Island of Dr. Moreau, the shipwrecked Edward Prendick discovers that the title vivisectionist performs painful experiments to transform animals into human-like “Beast Folk.” A year later Wells published The Invisible Man, which centers on a student of physics named Griffin who plans to use his invisibility to enact a “reign of terror.” However, Griffin’s invisibility makes it difficult for him to exist in society (he must cover himself with clothes and thick bandages if he wishes to be seen), and he is eventually killed by an angry crowd.\n\nAldous Huxley (1894–1963, United Kingdom). Aldous Huxley belonged to a prominent family of British intellectuals that included the Victorian evolutionist Thomas Henry Huxley. Although Aldous Huxley depicted his own social milieu in novels such as Crome Yellow and Point Counter Point, he is best known for writing about a dystopian “World State” in the 1932 novel Brave New World. Extrapolating from Henry Ford’s model of industrial production and contemporary advances in biochemistry, Huxley imagined a world in which the fictional “Bokanovsky’s Process” is used to create human clones, which are then modified to posses different intellectual abilities, and sorted into social castes named after the Greek letters Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon. Inhabitants of the World State enjoy a prosperous existence, immersive entertainment known as Feelies, and the drug soma, but lack family connections and spiritual fulfillment. The shallow pleasures of the World State are contrasted with the ideals of John the Savage, a young man who grew up on a New Mexico reservation. John is initially delighted to meet the World State residents Bernard Marx and Lenina Crowne, and excitedly quotes the “Brave New World” speech from Shakespeare’s play The Tempest. However, John soon grows disgusted with “civilization.” After the World Controller Mustapha Mond forbids John from living on an isolated island with the aspiring writer Helmholtz Watson, John unsuccessfully tries to retreat from society, and eventually hangs himself.\n\nGeorge Orwell (1903–1950, United Kingdom). George Orwell (the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair) condemned the totalitarian government of Joseph Stalin in the fantasy Animal Farm and the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell’s speculative fiction was part of a wide-ranging body of work that also included attacks on British colonialism (the essay “Shooting an Elephant” and the novel Burmese Days), first-hand accounts of war (Homage to Catalonia) and poverty (Down and Out in Paris and London, The Road to Wigan Pier), and works of cultural criticism (the essay “Politics and the English Language”). After taking part in the Spanish Civil War and growing alarmed at the authoritarian nature of Russian communism, Orwell wrote the 1945 novel Animal Farm as an allegory of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. Animal Farm describes barnyard animals who revolt against their owner, and try to create a more equitable society under the leadership of the pig Snowball, who develops principles of “Animalism” such as “Four legs good, two legs bad.” However, Snowball is soon ousted by his fellow pig Napoleon, who exploits the other animals, sends the horse Boxer to be slaughtered, and degrades the principles of Animalism to “all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” Four years later, Orwell imagined a future Britain subsumed into Oceania, a superpower under the harsh rule of “Big Brother”, in the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Winston Smith and his lover Julia try to rebel against Big Brother, but are tortured into compliance in the Ministry of Love. Nineteen Eighty-Four also described the distortion of the English language for political purposes (“Newspeak”), and introduced many words and phrases that are still used with reference to oppressive governments (thoughtcrime, doublethink, memory hole, “we’ve always been at war with Eastasia,” “war is peace,” “Big Brother is watching you”).\n\nIsaac Asimov (1920–1992, United States). Along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, Asimov was one of genre science fiction’s “Big Three” writers. During the 1930s’ and 1940s’ “Golden Age” of science fiction pulp magazines, Asimov worked closely with Astounding Science Fiction editor John W. Campbell Jr. to create stories such as “Nightfall,” which describes a rare moment of darkness on a planet with multiple suns, and “Robbie,” the first of Asimov’s many works about robots with positronic brains. (The word “robot” was introduced by the Czech author Karel Čapek in the 1920 play R.U.R., which depicts the worldwide uprising of “Rossum’s Universal Robots”). Before Asimov, most stories about artificial life had followed the template established by Shelley’s Frankenstein, in which a scientist who tries to usurp God’s power to create life is ultimately destroyed by his own creation. Asimov challenged this trope by creating the “Three Laws of Robotics,” which robots in his stories are obligated to follow: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws. By using these laws in dozens of stories (some of which were collected in the book I, Robot), Asimov helped to promote a conception of robots as useful machines rather than inhuman monsters. Asimov is also known for his Foundation series, which was inspired by Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. The Foundation series begins when the “psychohistorian” Hari Seldon realizes that the Galactic Empire will soon fall, and creates the title organization to limit the length of the ensuing Dark Age. Asimov eventually linked together his Robot and Foundation series into a far-reaching “history of the future,” which also includes Asimov’s novels The Caves of Steel, Pebble in the Sky, and The Stars, Like Dust.\n\nRay Bradbury (1920–2012, United States). Bradbury’s science fiction and fantasy stories often contain nostalgic elements related to his Midwestern childhood. The Illinois community Green Town is the setting of Bradbury’s novels Dandelion Wine and Something Wicked This Way Comes, both of which center on boys beginning to enter adulthood. Similarly, small towns on Earth and Mars are the setting of many stories in Bradbury’s 1950 collection The Martian Chronicles, which is made up of loosely connected works about the expeditions of human astronauts, the displacement of indigenous Martians as human settlers arrive, and a nuclear war that destroys most life on Earth. Bradbury also wrote about Mars in several stories that appear in his collection The Illustrated Man, whose title character has tattoos that foretell the future. Another theme that recurs in Bradbury’s works is censorship and the importance of literature. This theme is expressed most strongly in Bradbury’s 1953 novel Fahrenheit 451, which depicts a dystopian future in which “firemen” burn books. The protagonist of Fahrenheit 451 is Guy Montag, a fireman whose wife Mildred is deeply depressed and addicted to television programs that she watches on large “parlor walls.” Montag begins to question his profession after meeting the free-spirited Clarisse McClellan, and secretly preserves books to read, leading to a rebuke from Fire Captain Beatty. Montag is eventually pursued by a robotic attack dog called the “Mechanical Hound,” but escapes to join a community of rebels who memorize classic works of literature.\n\nKurt Vonnegut (1922–2007, United States). Vonnegut’s fiction provides a darkly humorous response to the absurdities and violence of the twentieth century. During World War II, Vonnegut was a prisoner of war in Germany, and lived through the Allied firebombing of Dresden. That experience was the basis for Vonnegut’s novel Slaughterhouse-Five, in which the soldier Billy Pilgrim becomes “unstuck in time,” and perceives his life in a non-linear fashion. Billy travels between the present, past, and future as he is captured by the German army, witnesses the destruction of Dresden, becomes a prosperous optometrist in the town of Ilium, is kidnapped by aliens and placed in a zoo along with the actress Montana Wildhack, and is eventually assassinated. Slaughterhouse-Five contains a number of elements that recur in other Vonnegut novels, including the veteran Eliot Rosewater, aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, the unsuccessful science fiction writer Kilgore Trout, and members of the wealthy Rumfoord family. Vonnegut also wrote the novel Cat’s Cradle, which describes a substance called “ice-nine” that instantly turns liquid water into a solid. Ice-nine was created by the atomic scientist Felix Hoenikker, whose life is researched by the novel’s narrator, John. Another thread in Cat’s Cradle concerns the “bittersweet lies” of the prophet Bokonon, who lives on the Caribbean island San Lorenzo. Bokonon comments on human stupidity after an accident that occurs during the funeral of the San Lorenzan dictator Papa Monzano causes ice-nine to fall into the ocean, destroying almost all life on Earth.\n\nMargaret Atwood (1939–present, Canada). One of Canada’s most prominent authors of literary fiction, Atwood has written multiple works that combine speculative elements with psychological realism. In 1985 Atwood published The Handmaid’s Tale, which portrays a dystopian near-future in which the United States has been replaced by the patriarchal Republic of Gilead. The Handmaid’s Tale is narrated by Offred, whose role as a “handmaid” is to bear children for “the Commander” and his wife, Serena Joy. Offred flees her oppressive existence with the help of Nick, a chauffeur who claims to be a member of the underground Mayday resistance movement. In an epilogue set in the year 2195, the archivist Professor Pieixoto discusses Offred’s unknown fate. Atwood later wrote a trilogy set in a post-apocalyptic world where corporations have created bioengineered diseases and people (Oryx and Crake, The Year of the Flood, and MaddAddam). In addition to her speculative works, Atwood has also written historical fiction (Alias Grace and The Blind Assassin, the latter of which contains a character who is a science fiction author), novels about the relationships between female friends (Cat’s Eye and The Robber Bride), and a retelling of Homer’s Odyssey from a female point of view (The Penelopiad).\n\nDouglas Adams (1952–2001, United Kingdom). Adams wrote comic science fiction and fantasy novels that poked fun at genre tropes and the quirks of British culture. After working on Monty Python’s Flying Circus, Adams created the BBC radio series The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which premiered in 1978. The radio series became the basis of a series of novels (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy; The Restaurant at the End of the Universe; Life, the Universe, and Everything; So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish; Mostly Harmless; and the authorized sequel And Another Thing…, which was written by Artemis Fowl author Eoin Colfer after Adams died). The Hitchhiker’s series focuses on Arthur Dent, an ordinary Englishman who becomes one of the last humans in the universe after Earth is destroyed by the alien Vogons. Arthur and his friend Ford Prefect travel on a starship named the Heart of Gold, along with the “paranoid android” Marvin, the two-headed galactic president Zaphod Beeblebrox, and the human scientist Trillian. Arthur eventually discovers that “answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything” is 42 (although the question itself remains unknown). Characters in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series sometimes consult the title reference work, which offers the advice “Don’t Panic,” encourages hitchhikers to carry towels at all times, and provides the recipe for a drink called the “Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.” Besides the Hitchhiker’s series, Adams also co-authored two books offering comic definitions of British place names (The Meaning of Liff and The Deeper Meaning of Liff), and wrote a pair of novels about the supernatural adventures of the private investigator Dirk Gently (Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency and The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul)."

    "title": "Supreme Court Cases (Part 2)",
    "content": "Chisholm v. Georgia (No majority opinion, Chief Justice John Jay, 4–1, 1793) Following the death of Robert Farquhar, his estate’s executor, Alexander Chisholm — who, like Farquhar, was a South Carolina resident — sued the state of Georgia to collect money Georgia owed Farquhar for goods it purchased during the American Revolution. Georgia claimed that sovereign immunity protected it from Chisholm’s suit. However, the Supreme Court held that Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution gave citizens the right to sue a state, finding against Georgia. The Court’s ruling proved so controversial that it resulted in the 1794 passage of the Eleventh Amendment, which specifically prohibited U.S. or foreign citizens from filing a lawsuit against a state (with certain exceptions).\n\nGibbons v. Ogden (John Marshall, 6–0, 1824) Thomas Gibbons and Aaron Ogden were partners in a steamboat business that ferried people between New York and New Jersey. Ogden had purchased a license granting him a monopoly under New York law. After the partners suffered a disagreement and split up, Gibbons applied for and received a federal permit to run a similar business. Ogden sued Gibbons for violating Ogden’s monopoly. In a unanimous decision, Marshall held that Congress’ interstate regulatory power under the Commerce Clause had “no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution.” Gibbons’ federal permit trumped Ogden’s state-granted monopoly.\n\nDred Scott v. Sandford (Roger Taney, 7–2, 1857) Dred Scott was a slave purchased by John Emerson in the 1820s, and who at various points lived in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory, both of which prohibited slavery. In 1853, Scott sued his then-owner John Sanford for his freedom. The Supreme Court ruled that no African-American — slave or free — was a citizen of the United States, and that therefore Scott lacked standing to initiate a lawsuit in the first place. In addition, the Court found the Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional, holding that Congress lacked authority to prohibit slavery in any new territory that was not originally part of the United States.\n\nMunn v. Illinois (Morrison Waite, 7–2, 1877) Ira Munn owned a set of Chicago grain elevators and charged oppressively high fees for their use. In 1871, the Illinois legislature passed a law setting maximum rates for grain storage. On appeal to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the business claimed that the Illinois statute violated Fourteenth-Amendment due process rights regarding private property. Chief Justice Waite’s opinion upheld the Illinois law, and proclaimed that “when private property is devoted to a public use, it is subject to public regulation.” The decision was a landmark in the history of government regulation of businesses, especially railroads.\n\nMuller v. Oregon (David Brewer, Melville Fuller, 9–0, 1908) Oregon laundry owner Curt Muller was fined for violating an Oregon law that limited the working hours of female employees; he appealed, claiming the law was an unconstitutional restriction of freedom of contract. Arguing on behalf of Oregon, future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis invoked scientific evidence to support the notion that excessive working hours were deleterious to a woman’s health. Oregon’s statute was upheld on the grounds that the state had a compelling interest in protecting the health of its female workers. One side effect of the decision was the judicial justification of sex discrimination in legislation.\n\nSchenck v. United States (Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Chief Justice Edward White, 9–0, 1919) The Espionage Act of 1917 prohibited — among other things — any attempt to inhibit recruitment by the U.S. Armed Forces. Charles Schenck was a Socialist who opposed conscription and distributed literature urging readers to resist the draft. Follwing his arrest and conviction, he appealed, claiming that his advocacy was protected speech covered by the First Amendment. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Holmes claimed the First Amendment does not protect speech that creates a “clear and present danger,” and that “the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting ‘fire’ in a theatre.”\n\nGriswold v. Connecticut (William O. Douglas, Earl Warren, 7–2, 1965) In 1879, Connecticut outlawed the use of contraception. In 1961, Estelle Griswold and Lee Buxton, who were directors of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut, were charged with violating that ban after they opened a birth control clinic. Justice Douglas’ majority opinion held that “specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras,” and that “emanations” of those guarantees create a Constitutional right to privacy that protects intensely personal decisions, such as the right of married couples to choose whether to use birth control. Connecticut’s law was struck down.\n\nMiranda v. Arizona (Earl Warren, 5–4, 1966) In 1963, Phoenix police arrested Ernesto Miranda on suspicion of kidnapping and rape; he subsequently confessed to those crimes. During his initial interrogation by police, Miranda was never informed of his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights. Writing for a thin majority, Chief Justice Warren stated that “[p]rior to any questioning, [a] person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed,” laying the groundwork for the iconic “Miranda warnings.”\n\nLoving v. Virginia (Earl Warren, 9–0, 1967) Virginia’s Racial Integrity Act of 1924 was an anti-miscegenation law that criminalized marriages between whites and non-whites. In 1958, Virginia residents Richard Loving (a white man) and Mildred Jeter (a woman of both African-American and Native American heritage) were married in Washington, D.C., which did not have such a statute. After returning to their Virginia home, they were arrested and convicted under the Racial Integrity Act. Striking down that Act as violating both the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, Chief Justice Warren wrote that “the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.”\n\nLawrence v. Texas (Anthony Kennedy, William Rehnquist, 6–3, 2003) In 1998, a false police report led Houston police to the apartment of John Lawrence; upon entering, deputies claimed they found Lawrence having sex with another man, Tyron Gardner. Both men were charged with homosexual conduct, still a misdemeanor in Texas. Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion held that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protected a person’s “liberty” to engage in consensual homosexual activity, and declared the Texas law unconstitutional. The decision in Lawrence overturned Bowers v. Hardwick (1986) — in which the court upheld a similar Georgia law — and has been cited as a key predecessor of both U.S. v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges."

    "title": "Scientific Scales",
    "content": "Temperature scales: The scales most frequently used to measure temperatures in science are the Kelvin and Celsius scales. The Celsius scale, developed by Swedish scientist Anders Celsius in the early 1700s, assigns a value of 0°C to the freezing point of water (at a pressure of 1 atmosphere), and 100°C to the boiling point of water (at the same pressure). Prior to 2019, the Kelvin scale is based on the triple point of water, the point at which water’s solid, liquid, and gaseous phases can coexist in equilibrium: 1 K was defined as 1/273.16 of the temperature of water at its triple point. (In 2019 the definition was changed to be in terms of the Boltzmann constant, but the value is still essentially as just described.) Kelvins are treated like all other SI units: a temperature of 100 K is read as “one hundred kelvins,” not “one hundred degrees kelvin.” Differences on the Celsius scale have the same magnitude as differences on the Kelvin scale: a gap of 1°C between temperatures is the same as a gap of 1 K. Therefore the lowest possible temperature, absolute zero (0 K) is equal to –273.15°C, and (at a pressure of 1 atmosphere) water freezes at 273.15 K and boils at 373.15 K.\n\nMach number: Mach numbers measure speed. Based on a suggestion by Swiss aeronautical engineer Jakob Ackeret, it was named after Ernst Mach, an Austrian physicist who studied — among other things — the Doppler effect, sensory perception, and the origin of inertia. The Mach number is defined as the ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the same medium. So an object moving at the speed of sound (which in dry air at 20°C is about 343 m/s) has a speed of Mach 1, and an object moving at twice the speed of sound has a speed of Mach 2.\n\nDecibel scale: The decibel scale can describe any kind of power, but is most commonly used to describe the intensity of sound waves. The decibel (abbreviated dB) is one tenth of a larger unit, the bel (abbreviated B), named after inventor Alexander Graham Bell. The intensity of a sound in decibels is given by the formula I = 10 log(P1/P0), where P1 is the intensity of the sound being measured (in watts per square meter) and P0 is a reference intensity, which is based on the least powerful sound wave that can be detected by the average human ear (namely 10–12 W/m2). A 10-dB increase in sound intensity corresponds to multiplying the energy of the sound wave by 10. A normal conversation has a volume of about 70 dB.\n\npH scale: The pH scale, developed by S. P. L. Sørensen in 1909, is used to quantify acidity. The pH (power of hydrogen) of a solution is defined as the opposite of the (base-10) logarithm of the concentration of protons in a solution: pH = –log10[H+]. (The brackets are standard notation in chemistry for “the concentration of.”) Thus, greater concentrations of protons correspond to smaller pH values. At 25°C, the neutral (neither acidic nor basic) pH is 7; solutions with a pH less than 7 are considered acidic, and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are considered basic.\n\nRichter scale: The Richter scale measures earthquake intensity. Developed by Caltech professor Charles Francis Richter, it measures the shaking intensity associated with earthquakes, as quantified by the amplitude of vibrations on a seismograph. A magnitude-5.0 earthquake will have an amplitude 10 times larger than that of a magnitude 4.0 quake. The energy associated with an earthquake is actually proportional to the 3/2 power of the magnitude: a 1-point difference on the Richter scale corresponds to a 103/2-fold (about 31.6) difference in energy. Because of difficulties in measuring the magnitudes of large earthquakes, the Richter scale has been superseded by the moment magnitude scale, which uses a different formula but retains the logarithmic nature (and correlates to measurements on the Richter scale).\n\nBeaufort wind force scale: The first official use of the Beaufort scale was on the voyage of the HMS Beagle in 1831, which was led by Robert FitzRoy, who had been trained by the scale’s namesake, Sir Francis Beaufort, a rear admiral in the British Navy. The Beaufort scale is primarily based on wind speed, but also incorporates descriptions of wave height, sea conditions, and land conditions. It starts at 0, corresponding to “calm” winds with a speed less than 1 knot. In most parts of the world, it stops at 12, which is designated “hurricane-force winds.” Scores of 2 to 6 are called “breezes,” and scores of 7 to 10 are called “gales.” Since 1946 the median wind speed for each step has been defined as 1.87 B3/2, where B is the number on the Beaufort scale.\n\nFujita-Pearson and Enhanced Fujita scales: These scales measure tornado strength. The Fujita-Pearson scale was introduced in 1971 by Ted Fujita, a meteorology professor at the University of Chicago, and Allen Pearson, director of what is now the Storm Prediction Center. The original scale went from F0 (wind speeds lower than hurricane force, which should cause little to no damage) to F5 (wind speeds of 260 miles per hour, which should cause “incredible damage”). Fujita also included an “inconceivable damage” category for tornados exceeding 319 miles per hour (theoretically possible, but no such tornado has ever been observed). In 2007 the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale was introduced, narrowing the speed ranges for each category: an EF5 begins at “just” 200 miles per hour.\n\nMohs scale: Invented by Friedrich Mohs in 1812, the Mohs scale is based on the abilities of minerals to scratch one another. The original scale assigned a value of 1 to talc, which can be scratched by essentially every solid known, and a value of 10 to diamond, which (among naturally occurring minerals) can only be scratched by other diamonds. The steps are of arbitrary size, with a 1-point difference corresponding to anywhere from a 1.5-fold to a 4-fold increase in hardness; diamond is about 1600 times harder than talc. Following the discovery of more ultra-hard minerals, scientists have proposed extending the scale so that diamond is 15 instead of 10.\n\nPauling scale: The Pauling scale, devised by Linus Pauling in 1932, is one of several scales that measure electronegativity, the extent to which atoms attract electrons in chemical bonds. Higher values correspond to stronger attractions. Francium has the lowest value, about 0.7, while fluorine has the highest value, about 4.0. (Noble gases are not assigned values on the Pauling scale, since they were not known to form any bonds when Pauling devised it.) Differences in electronegativity characterize bonds: the greater the difference, the more ionic the bond.\n\nSaffir-Simpson scale: The Saffir-Simpson scale is a measure of wind speed and damage from hurricanes. It was developed in 1971 by Herbert Saffir, a civil engineer, and Robert Simpson, then the director of the National Hurricane Center. It rates hurricanes on a 1-to-5 scale: a 1 corresponds to a wind speed of 74 to 95 miles per hour, which causes “some damage.” A 5 causes “catastrophic damage,” with wind speeds over 157 miles per hour and affected areas uninhabitable for weeks or months."

    "title": "Campaigns In The Pacific Theater Of World War Ii",
    "content": "Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945): Japan’s invasion of China was the primary cause of World War II in East Asia. As early as 1931, Japanese forces occupied Manchuria and set up a puppet state called Manchukuo. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident of 1937 resulted in open war between Japan and China. Japanese forces committed notorious atrocities during the invasion of China, including the 1937 massacres known as the Rape of Nanking. The Chinese war effort was hindered by internal conflict between Chiang Kai-Shek’s Nationalist Kuomintang government and the communist insurgency led by Mao Zedong. Between 1942 and 1945 central China was largely cut off from the outside world due to Japanese conquest of coastal ports; Allied support was limited to air power deployed over the Himalayas from India, including the fighter pilots known as the “Flying Tigers.”\n\nAttack on Pearl Harbor (December 1941): Japanese plans for domination of the Pacific called for a surprise attack on the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii; wrecking the American Pacific Fleet would allow the Japanese navy to invade southeast Asia with minimal opposition. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto planned the Japanese strike, which sent carrier-based dive bombers and torpedo bombers to Oahu on Sunday, December 7, 1941. Four American battleships, including the USS Arizona, were sunk; the American aircraft carriers were at sea away from Pearl Harbor at the time of the attack. The losses sustained at Pearl Harbor shocked the previously neutral United States into entering World War II. President Franklin Roosevelt’s address to Congress described December 7 as a “date which will live in infamy.”\n\nBattle of Bataan (January to May 1942): Immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese bombers struck the Philippine island Luzon, forcing the Americans to retreat to the Bataan Peninsula, where they held out for four months. General Douglas MacArthur vowed “I shall return” before evacuating to Australia and leaving command to Jonathan Wainwright, who retreated to the island of Corregidor and surrendered on May 6. The prisoners from Bataan were sent on a “death march” 80 miles to San Fernando with minimal food, water, and medical supplies; those that fell behind were beaten. Japanese General Masaharu Homma was executed in 1946 for his role in the war crime.\n\nFall of Singapore (February 1942): Japan’s offensive in southeast Asia also struck at the British Empire. Japanese aircraft sank the British battleship Prince of Wales and drove obsolete British aircraft from the skies over the Malay Peninsula. Allied troops were driven back toward Singapore, Britain’s major base in the Far East. Reinforcements from Britain and Australia arrived too late to repair the situation, and British general Arthur Percival was forced to surrender in February 1942. The loss of Singapore stunned the British Empire. Many Indian prisoners captured at Singapore switched sides to fight for the Japanese; British and Australian POWs labored in terrible conditions on the Siam-Burma railway depicted in the novel The Bridge over the River Kwai.\n\nBattle of the Coral Sea (May 1942): The Battle of the Coral Sea resulted from Japanese ambitions to invade Port Moresby, an Allied base in New Guinea. Frank Jack Fletcher’s American fleet damaged two Japanese aircraft carriers, Shokaku and Zuikaku. The U.S. Navy’s major loss was the carrier Lexington. The battle, a tactical draw, prevented the Japanese from attacking Port Moresby. It is notable for being the first naval battle fought entirely by aircraft — neither fleet was ever in visual range of the other’s ships.\n\nBattle of Midway (June 1942): Midway is considered the turning point of World War II in the Pacific. Japanese Admiral Yamamoto launched attacks on both Midway Island — an atoll northwest of Hawaii — and the Aleutian Islands in Alaska, but the Americans had broken the Japanese naval code and were forewarned. Admiral Chester W. Nimitz’s American fleet lost the aircraft carrier Yorktown, but American dive-bombers destroyed four Japanese carriers: Soryu, Akagi, Kaga, and Hiryu. The loss of four irreplaceable aircraft carriers and the death of the best-trained Japanese pilots crippled Japanese naval aviation for the duration of the war.\n\nGuadalcanal Campaign (August 1942 to February 1943): This first Allied counteroffensive in the Pacific targeted Guadalcanal, an island in the Solomons, to secure communications between the U.S. Pacific coast and Australia. “Operation Watchtower” was the codename for the initial U.S. Marine landings, which secured an airbase at Henderson Field and held off a Japanese counterattack on Edson’s Ridge. The naval battle of Savo Island took place between American ships and Japanese forces (the so-called “Tokyo Express”) trying to resupply troops on Guadalcanal. By early 1943, Allied dominance of the seas and skies around Guadalcanal forced Japan to withdraw its remaining troops.\n\nBattle of Leyte Gulf (October 1944): The American landings on the island of Leyte in the fall of 1944 fulfilled Douglas MacArthur’s promise to return to the Philippines. Most of the Imperial Japanese Navy’s remaining strength emerged to challenge the Allied landing, setting up one of the largest naval battles in world history. American admiral William “Bull” Halsey was criticized for the poorly-coordinated response to the Japanese attack. Nevertheless, American ships, aircraft, and submarines were able to destroy more than two dozen Japanese vessels, including the giant battleship Musashi. The Japanese position was by now so desperate that Japan began the practice of suicidal kamikaze attacks on Allied naval vessels.\n\nBattle of Iwo Jima (February to March 1945): Iwo Jima is an isolated volcanic island between the Marianas and Honshu; early in 1945 it was strategically important as a base for American air attacks on the Japanese home islands. The defenders were led by General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, who attempted to prolong the battle indefinitely by digging an elaborate system of tunnels to protect his troops. The U.S Marines who stormed the island starting in February 1945 sustained thousands of casualties. Joe Rosenthal’s photograph of Marines raising the flag on Iwo’s Mount Suribachi is one of the best known images of the Second World War.\n\nBattle of Okinawa (April to June 1945): Codenamed Operation Iceberg, the invasion of Okinawa was the last major ground battle in the Pacific theater of World War II. Kakazu Ridge and Shuri Castle were among the positions Japanese troops defended against U.S. Marine and Army units. Okinawa was the high point of Japanese kamikaze attacks; over 1,500 suicide missions were sent against the Allied invasion fleet. The heavy casualties sustained by both sides on Okinawa and the suicidal bravery of the Japanese military encouraged American planners to use atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki instead of launching Operation Downfall, the projected late-1945 conventional invasion of the Japanese home islands."

    "title": "British Reform Movements",
    "content": "Lollards (late 14th century) This group agitated for the reform of Western Christianity and was given the derogatory name “Lollards.” The Lollards followed the example of John Wycliffe, a theologian whose criticism of the Church got him fired from his position at the University of Oxford in 1381. Wycliffe is best known today for being one of the first to translate the Bible into English (the first of his translations came out in 1382 and circulated widely). He and the Lollards also challenged the privileged status of the clergy, calling at various times for a lay clergy, an end to clerical celibacy, the end of confession to priests, and a ban on priests holding temporal offices. The Lollards were driven underground, especially after the suppression of a 1414 uprising by Sir John Oldcastle, but their ideas presaged many of those later adopted during the English Reformation. In the wake of Oldcastle’s Rebellion, Wycliffe was posthumously declared a heretic at the 1415 Council of Constance, after which his corpse was exhumed and posthumously beheaded.\n\nPuritans (16th and 17th centuries) The Puritans were English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries who tried to push the English Reformation further by “purifying” the Church of England of any remaining Roman Catholic influences. The word “Puritan” is applied inconsistently to groups espousing a variety of different religious positions; today, it often refers to somebody who is opposed to seeking pleasure. When studying 17th-century England, it is important to note the distinction between “separatist” Puritans, who wanted to break away from the Church of England, and “non-separatist” Puritans, who wanted to reform the church while remaining members of it. The Pilgrims who sailed on the Mayflower were separatists; the main group of colonists who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony under John Winthrop were non-separatists. After the English Civil War, under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, Puritans enjoyed a brief period of power in England, during which time they closed theaters, limited sports, and instituted harsh penalties for breaking the Sabbath.\n\nLevellers and Diggers (mid-17th century) During the English Civil War, the opponents of the monarchy included holders of a wide range of political beliefs. Those politicians and soldiers who wanted to extend suffrage and establish equality before the law were known as Levellers, a pejorative term probably referring to the fact that they wanted all people to live on a common level. Some radicals, inspired by the Book of Acts, went even further in attempting to establish egalitarianism in the English countryside by trying to farm on common land. Because they dug up this land, they became known as Diggers, but preferred to call themselves the “True Levellers.” The Levellers, who were less radical than the Diggers, had considerably more influence on English politics. Several Leveller leaders were invited to debate the main leaders of the New Model Army during the 1647 Putney Debates about the formation of a new English constitution. In the end, both the Levellers and the Diggers were suppressed by Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton.\n\nLuddites (early 19th century) As the Industrial Revolution accelerated in the early 19th century, many skilled textile workers were replaced by unskilled laborers who could use newly invented machines. The most vocal opponents of textile mechanization were known as Luddites, a term said to have derived from the surname of a youth named Ned Ludd, who broke two stocking frames in 1779. Between 1811 and 1813, organized groups of Luddites clashed with the British military at mills in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. In response, Parliament passed the Frame Breaking Act, which made industrial sabotage a capital crime. While the Luddites were suppressed relatively quickly, the perpetrators of the Swing Riots in Kent in 1830 employed similar tactics by demolishing threshing machines to protest the mechanization of agriculture. Today, the term “Luddite” refers more generally to anybody who is uncomfortable with technology.\n\nChartists (19th century) Another working-class reform movement in industrial England was the Chartist movement, so named because it advocated the adoption of the People’s Charter of 1838. The Charter was written by six members of Parliament and six workers. It called for democratization of the political system by instituting universal suffrage, secret ballots, the abolition of property qualifications to stand for election, salaries for members of Parliament, constituencies of equal size, and annual parliamentary elections. The Chartist movement inspired several mass rallies, peaking in size in 1848 as the rest of Europe was swept up in revolution. The Chartist movement did not directly inspire any political reforms, but Parliament gradually granted five of the six demands of the Charter (the demand for annual elections was the only one never implemented).\n\nAnti-Corn Law League (early-mid 19th century) From 1838 to 1846, the leading organization agitating for repeal of the Corn Laws was the Anti-Corn Law League. The Corn Laws were a series of laws that imposed tariffs on imported grain (“corn” was at that time a generic term for types of grain that require grinding, including wheat), which kept grain prices high to benefit English landowners. The founders of the Anti-Corn Law League, Richard Cobden and John Bright, argued that importing grain would lower food prices for workers and thus stimulate the British economy. The Corn Laws were eventually repealed in 1846 under the leadership of Conservative Prime Minister Robert Peel, a decision hastened by the start of the Irish Potato Famine the previous year. The repeal of the Corn Laws ushered in an era of support for free trade that continues to this day. Another legacy of opposition to the Corn Laws was the founding of the weekly publication The Economist in 1843 to promote repeal of trade restrictions.\n\nReform League(mid-late 19th century) A variety of organizations, including the Reform League, sprung up in 1865 to promote universal suffrage in the United Kingdom. Universal suffrage had been one of the demands of the Chartist Movement, but Parliament had not enacted it. The Reform League staged mass meetings to influence parliamentary proceedings, including a rally in Hyde Park in 1866 that forced the resignation of Spencer Walpole as Home Secretary. The Reform League’s platform was eventually enacted in 1867, during Benjamin Disraeli’s prime ministry. The Second Reform Act of 1867 enfranchised urban working-class males in England and Wales (further bills enfranchised Scotland and Ireland the following year).\n\nFabian Society (1884–present) One of the most influential intellectual communities in British history was the Fabian Society, an organization founded in 1884 to promote the gradual adoption of socialism. The society was named for the Roman general Fabius Maximus, who avoided fighting pitched battles against Hannibal and instead won a gradual war of attrition. The Fabian Society pressed for progressive economic measures that went far beyond the platform of the Liberal Party, including a minimum wage and universal health care. Prominent members of the Fabian Society included George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Virginia Woolf, Ramsay MacDonald, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb. In 1900, many members of the Fabian Society founded the Labour Party, a socialist rival to the two major parties, which eventually came to power in 1924 under Ramsay MacDonald. Today, the Fabian Society continues to exist as a left-wing think tank.\n\nSuffragettes (early 20th century) In the early 20th century, many different groups began to clamor for voting rights to be extended to women. The most militant advocates for women’s suffrage became known as Suffragettes. This term is especially associated with Emmeline Pankhurst and her organization, the Women’s Social and Political Union. In the 1910s, many Suffragettes adopted militant tactics to draw attention to their cause, including Emily Davison’s protest at the Epsom Derby in 1913 when she was trampled and killed by the King’s horse, a slashing attack by Mary Richardson on Diego Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus in 1914, and the 1914 bombing of the Coronation Chair inside Westminster Abbey. Many Suffragettes who were arrested went on hunger strikes, leading the government of Herbert Asquith to pass the Cat and Mouse Act, which allowed hunger strikers to be released and subsequently re-arrested. In 1918, Parliament finally extended voting rights to women over the age of 30 who met property qualifications.\n\nNational Union of Mineworkers (late 20th century) This list would not be complete without some mention of the organizations that opposed the conservative economic measures imposed by the government of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. One conflict that deserves particular attention is the strike led by the National Union of Mineworkers in 1984 and 1985 under the leadership of Arthur Scargill. The entire British coal industry had been nationalized by Clement Attlee’s Labour government in 1947. In 1984, the Thatcher government announced a plan to close 20 coal mining pits as a way of reducing government subsidies to the mines, which precipitated a strike. By March 1985, the Thatcher government had outlasted the strikers, effectively breaking the power of one of Britain’s most powerful unions. The British coal industry was privatized in 1994. Today, most of Britain’s coal is imported, and the former mining areas have some of the highest unemployment rates in the country."

    "content": "Montezuma II (c. 1466–1520) was one of the last rulers of the Aztec empire. In 1519 Montezuma allowed armed forces led by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés to enter the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán. Several months later, the Spanish imprisoned Montezuma within his own palace. After the conquistador Pedro de Alvarado took advantage of Montezuma’s captivity to massacre peaceful celebrants at a religious festival, the Aztecs selected a new ruler named Cuitláhuac, and the city erupted into conflicts that led to Montezuma’s death. The Spanish then fled during an escape that is called the “Noche Triste,” or “Sad Night” because many conquistadors died while crossing the causeways that connected the island city Tenochtitlán to the shores of Lake Texcoco. By 1521, the ravages of smallpox and the help of indigenous Tlaxcalan allies allowed Cortés to conquer Tenochtitlán and to capture Cuauhtémoc, the final Aztec emperor.\n\nMiguel Hidalgo (1753–1811) was a parish priest who became the leader of Mexico’s first independence movement. After Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 1808 and ousted the Spanish king Ferdinand VII, political movements advocating Enlightenment ideas of representative government and local self-determination sprung up in many of Spain’s American colonies. Hidalgo belonged to one such group, which officials in the viceroyalty of New Spain attempted to suppress. In response, Hidalgo called his congregation together and issued a call for revolt known as the “Grito de Dolores,” or “Cry of Dolores” on September 16, 1810. The rebels captured the cities Guanajuato and Guadalajara, but were unable to take Mexico City. In 1811, Hidalgo was captured and executed by the colonial regime. The leadership of the independence movement then fell to another priest named José María Morelos, who was himself executed in 1815. Although Hidalgo’s movement was unsuccessful, September 16 is still celebrated as Mexico’s official Day of Independence.\n\nAgustín de Iturbide (1783–1824) was a royalist general who changed his allegiances to become the first ruler of independent Mexico. Like many Creoles, or people of European descent born in the Americas, Iturbide feared that the insurgency would upset colonial hierarchies of race and class. In 1820, however, a liberal revolution in Spain caused conservative Mexican elites to reconsider the benefits of independence. Iturbide reached out to the insurgent leader Vicente Guerrero, and agreed to endorse legal racial equality in exchange for Guerrero’s military support. Early in 1821 Iturbide released the Plan of Iguala, which is also known as the “Plan of the Three Guarantees” or “Plan Trigarante” because it called for Mexican independence, a wholly Catholic state, and the equality of all races. Iturbide’s Army of the Three Guarantees soon forced Juan O’Donoju, the last viceroy of New Spain, to acknowledge Mexican independence in the Treaty of Córdoba. In 1822 Iturbide became the first emperor of Mexico, but a revolt led by Antonio López de Santa Anna forced Iturbide into exile in 1823. When Iturbide returned to Mexico in 1824, he was quickly executed.\n\nAntonio López de Santa Anna (1794–1876) was a general who served as president of Mexico eleven different times between 1833 and 1855. After gaining independence, many Latin American nations fell under the rule of caudillos, or charismatic leaders who exercised both military and political power. As one of these figures, Santa Anna cultivated an image of himself as a savior of the Mexican nation, and even held an elaborate funeral for the leg that he lost during a conflict with France known as the “Pastry War.” However, Santa Anna proved unable to prevent the loss of Mexico’s northern territories. Despite routing the defenders of the Alamo, Santa Anna was defeated by the forces of Sam Houston at the 1836 Battle of San Jacinto, and was forced to recognize Texan independence. A little more than a decade later, Santa Anna seized control of the government during the Mexican-American War, only to lose major battles at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec, and be forced into exile. He returned to Mexico in 1853 and tried to establish a permanent dictatorship, but was challenged by the Liberal Plan of Ayutla, and was driven from power in 1855.\n\nBenito Juárez (1806–1872) was a Liberal lawyer who became the first indigenous president of Mexico, and who led the opposition to the French-backed empire of Maximilian von Habsburg. Born to a Zapotec family in the state of Oaxaca, Juárez became a key figure in the Liberal movement that deposed Santa Anna, and which initiated legal and social changes known as La Reforma (“the Reform”). An 1855 law named after Juárez sought to eliminate special privileges given to members of the church and military, and was incorporated into a new constitution ratified in 1857. Conservative backlash soon led to the War of the Reform, which lasted from 1857 to 1861, and left the victorious Liberals with little money in the national treasury. France’s emperor Napoleon III then used Mexico’s foreign debts to as a pretext for an invasion known as the “French Intervention,” which briefly imposed the Austrian archduke Maximilian as Mexico’s second emperor. As the elected president of Mexico, Juárez evaded capture by French and imperial troops while rallying Republican forces. After the departure of the French, Liberal troops captured and executed Maximilian on the Hill of the Bells in the city of Querétaro. Juárez returned to Mexico City, and remained president until his death.\n\nPorfirio Díaz (1830–1915) was a Liberal general who established a long-lasting dictatorship that eventually led to the Mexican Revolution. In 1876 Díaz issued the Plan of Tuxtepec and seized power from the Liberal president Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada. Díaz then dominated Mexican politics for the next 35 years, and served as president continuously between 1884 and 1911 despite his earlier use of the slogan “Effective Suffrage and No Re-Election.” While in office, Díaz skillfully manipulated federal, state, and local politics, suppressed dissent, tamed the fractious Mexican army, opened Mexico to foreign investment, and oversaw the beginnings of the country’s industrial development. His supporters praised him as a brilliant statesman who had ended the upheavals of the mid-nineteenth century; his detractors stressed the inequality, corruption, and systematic brutality of the political and economic systems fostered by Díaz and his positivist advisors, who were known as Científicos. In 1908 Díaz discussed the possibility of his resignation during an interview with the American journalist James Creelman, which helped open the door to electoral mobilization, and eventually to armed rebellion. The Anti-Reelectionist forces of Francisco Madero revolted in 1910 and won their first victories in 1911, sparking uprisings elsewhere in the country. Díaz promptly resigned under terms stipulated in the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez, and spent the last years of his life in comfortable European exile.\n\nFrancisco Madero (1873–1913) led the 1910 revolution against Porfirio Díaz, and served as president of Mexico from 1911 to 1913. As the idealistic son of a wealthy Coahuilan family, Madero was in some ways an unlikely revolutionary. However, Madero’s idealism allowed him to challenge Díaz with a boldness that more powerful politicians and generals had lacked. After the Creelman interview was released, Madero wrote a book titled The Presidential Succession in 1910, which argued that it was time for Díaz to be replaced, and which revived Díaz’s former slogan, “Effective Suffrage and No Re-Election.” Madero then ran for president, but was arrested before the election. After escaping from prison, Madero issued the Plan of San Luis Potosí, which called for a general revolt in November 1910. Dissatisfaction with the Díaz regime coalesced around Madero, who unseated the dictator and took power after democratic elections were held in the fall of 1911. However, Madero was unable to satisfy the far-reaching demands of the diverse coalition that had brought him to power. Madero was also disliked by the American ambassador Henry Lane Wilson and by former supporters of the Díaz regime, many of whom retained their positions in the government and army. In February 1913, Wilson encouraged General Victoriano Huerta to participate in a coup against Madero. After a period of fighting within Mexico City that is known as the Decena Trágica, or Tragic Ten Days, Madero was forced to resign. Huerta became president, and Madero was murdered a few days later.\n\nVenustiano Carranza (1859–1920) was the “First Chief” of the Constitutionalist army during the Mexican Revolution, and president of Mexico from 1917 to 1920. After the death of Francisco Madero, Carranza issued the Plan of Guadalupe, and became the nucleus of opposition to Victoriano Huerta’s regime. Carranza’s movement was supported by the generals Pablo González, Álvaro Obregón, and Pancho Villa, who assembled armies in northern Mexico and pushed south to the capital. The southern general Emiliano Zapata also allied with Carranza to remove Huerta from power. After Huerta was forced to resign in 1914, members of Carranza’s movement held a convention in the city of Aguascalientes. The convention formed a new government that was supported by Villa and Zapata, but opposed by González and Obregón. Constitutionalist and Convention forces battled until 1915, when Carranza’s adherents gained the upper hand and the Convention split into separate factions, some of which continued to fight the Constitutionalists for years. Carranza went on to call for a new constitution, to be based on the Liberal Constitution of 1857. The ensuing Constitution of 1917 went far beyond the minor reforms that Carranza had envisioned, and promoted land redistribution, workers’ rights, anticlericalism, and national ownership of Mexico’s natural resources. Over the next several years, Carranza proved reluctant to enact the 1917 constitution’s more radical provisions, or to give up control of the government. Obregón forced Carranza to flee the capital in 1920, and likely had a role in Carranza’s subsequent assassination.\n\nEmiliano Zapata (1879–1919) and Pancho Villa (born Doroteo Arango) (1878–1923) were both early supporters of Francisco Madero, opponents of Victoriano Huerta, and leaders of the Convention forces during the Mexican Revolution. Villa chiefly operated in northern Mexico, while Zapata was based in his home state, Morelos, south of Mexico City. In 1911 Villa and Pascual Orozco led Maderista forces at the Battle of Ciudad Juárez, while Zapata issued the Plan of Ayala, which called for the breakup of large haciendas and the restoration of communal lands known as ejidos. During Madero’s presidency Villa was imprisoned by Victoriano Huerta, who also conducted a brutal military campaign against the peasant supporters of Zapata. After Madero’s death, Villa joined Carranza’s army as the leader of the División del Norte, or Division of the North, and Zapata established himself as the central leader of the various southern guerrilla movements. At the Convention of Aguascalientes, Villa’s supporters sought to promote the rights of peasants and workers; Zapatistas took a less active role at the meeting, but were willing to support the Convention government in opposition to Carranza. In the subsequent fighting, Zapatista soldiers took the capital several times but were unable to hold it after 1915, the same year that Villa suffered defeats at the battles of Celaya and Agua Prieta. Zapata retreated to Morelos and carried out local land reforms as the Constitutionalists focused on defeating Villa, who sought to obtain supplies by carrying out a 1916 raid on the American town of Columbus, New Mexico. In response to this incursion, the U.S. sent a “punitive expedition” led by General John J. Pershing to (unsuccessfully) pursue Villa across northern Mexico. The influence of Villa and Zapata declined, and both were eventually assassinated. However, the two men remain symbols of the Revolution’s popular aspirations. Zapata in particular has served as an inspiration to later movements such as the Chiapas-based EZLN, or Zapatista Army of National Liberation.\n\nLázaro Cárdenas (1895–1970) was a revolutionary general who served as president from 1934 to 1940, and who worked to fulfill the Constitution of 1917’s promises of land reform and nationalization of key resources. After Carranza’s death, Mexico was ruled by the “Sonoran dynasty” of Álvaro Obregón and Plutarco Elías Calles, who stabilized the country and implemented limited reforms. Calles also founded a forerunner of the PRI, or Institutional Party of the Revolution, which dominated Mexican politics throughout the 20th century. After stepping down as president, Calles continued to control Mexican politics from 1928 to 1934 during a period known as the “Maximato.” However, Cárdenas surprised Calles by turning against him, and forcing him into exile. As president, Cárdenas also broke up large estates into communal ejidos, promoted organized labor, and expropriated foreign-owned oil fields in 1938 to form the national oil company Pemex, or Petróleos Mexicanos. These actions made Cárdenas very popular, but once he left office the Mexican government’s commitment to economic redistribution soon waned. In 1988 Lázaro’s son Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas challenged PRI control of politics by running for president as the candidate of the PRD, or Party of the Democratic Revolution. Although electoral fraud prevented Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas from winning, his challenge helped to bring about political changes that eventually led Vicente Fox of the PAN, or National Action Party, to be elected president in 2000."

    "content": "Marco Polo (c. 1254 – c. 1324): The Venetian merchant brothers Niccolò and Maffeo Polo traveled to China in 1261, serving Kublai Khan from 1266 to 1269. Kublai sent them back to Europe as envoys in 1269; when they returned to China in 1274 they brought Niccolò’s son Marco along. The Polos served Kublai Khan until 1292, with Marco spending time as governor of Yangzhou. After being captured by the Genoese at the naval Battle of Curzola, Marco Polo dictated his memoir — a text known as Il Milione — to his prison cellmate, Rusticiano (or Rusticello) of Pisa.\n\nChristopher Columbus (1451–1506): On his first voyage (1492), Christopher Columbus sailed for Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, taking the Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria and landing at San Salvador in the Bahamas (where he dubbed the Arawak inhabitants “Indians”) before discovering Hispaniola and founding the settlement of Navidad there. On his second voyage (1493), he returned to Hispaniola before discovering Jamaica. On his third voyage (1498), he discovered South America, and on his fourth voyage (1502), he landed in Central America.\n\nJohn Cabot (1450–1499), Jacques Cartier (1491–1557), and Samuel de Champlain (c. 1567–1635): Three early explorers of Canada. John Cabot, a Genoese explorer, sailed for Henry VII of England. Cabot’s 1497 voyage aboard the Matthew landed somewhere in eastern Canada, probably in what is today Newfoundland. Frenchman Jacques Cartier went on three expeditions (1534–1542) for Francis I. On the second one, he sailed up the St. Lawrence River and named the hill behind the village of Hochelaga “Montréal.” Fellow Frenchman Samuel de Champlain went on several voyages (1603–1635), founding what is now Quebec City and becoming the first European to see Lake Huron.\n\nFerdinand Magellan (c. 1480–1521): Emperor Charles V endorsed Magellan’s proposal to sail around the Americas and across the Pacific, and the expedition left in 1519. Magellan began with five ships: the San Antonio, Trinidad, Concepción, Santiago, and Victoria. The expedition discovered and navigated the Strait of Magellan in 1520, reaching the Philippines in 1521. There, Magellan was killed in battle on the island Mactan. Only the Victoria, commanded by Juan Sebastián Elcano, returned to Spain in 1522.\n\nHernan Cortés (c. 1485–1547): Spanish conquistador who participated in the conquest of Cuba. In 1519 the Cuban governor Diego Velázquez (no relation to the painter of the same name) commissioned Cortés to sail west and explore the mainland coast. Fearing that Velázquez would change his mind, Cortés left Cuba secretly and began a mission of conquest rather than exploration. On the coast of the Yucatán, the Cortés expedition was joined by the Spanish castaway Gerónimo de Aguilar and a Nahua captive known as “La Malinche” or “Doña Marina,” who served as translators. After traveling north, Cortés and his men defied the authority of Velázquez by founding the city Veracruz, an act which allowed Cortés to take legal control of the expedition. The Spanish then pressed inland, surviving an attempted massacre in the city Cholula and making allies with the Tlaxcalans, who were traditional enemies of the Aztecs. Upon reaching the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, Cortés and his men were welcomed by the Aztec emperor Montezuma II. Cortés took Montezuma prisoner, but was forced to return to the coast to deal with a punitive expedition sent by Velázquez and commanded by Panfilo de Narvaez. Although Cortés won the new arrivals over to his side, the situation in Tenochtitlan deteriorated as the conquistador Pedro de Alvarado murdered celebrants at a festival. Shortly after Cortés returned to the city, Montezuma was killed and the Spanish were forced to flee during the Noche Triste (Night of Sorrows). After escaping, Cortés marshalled Spanish and indigenous forces to fight the Aztecs, who were successively led by the emperors Cuitlahuac and Cuauhtemoc. After the Aztec defenders were seriously weakened by an outbreak of smallpox, Cortés and his followers captured Tenochtitlan in 1521 and rebuilt it as Mexico City. Much of our knowledge of the conquest of Mexico comes from a follower of Cortes named Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who wrote detailed memoirs of the expedition.\n\nFrancisco Pizarro (c. 1475–1541): After receiving a commission from Emperor Charles V, Francisco Pizarro went with his partner Diego de Almagro, the priest Hernando de Luque, and a small force to Peru (1530). The invaders marched to the city Cajamarca, where they seized the emperor Atahualpa and held him for ransom. Even though the Incas brought the Spanish a ransom of precious metal, Pizarro killed Atahualpa and captured the Incan capital, Cuzco. In 1535 Pizarro founded Lima, where he was murdered six years later.\n\nSir Francis Drake (c. 1543–1596): In 1576, Elizabeth I of England sent Francis Drake to find the unknown southern continent. Drake’s ship was the Pelican, which he renamed the Golden Hind. After sailing through the Strait of Magellan, Drake sailed up the western coast of South, Central, and North America as far as California, capturing Spanish ships and treasure along the way. After circumnavigating the globe and returning to England (1580), Drake fought against the Spanish Armada (1588).\n\nHenry Hudson (ca. 1565–1611): Sailing for the Dutch in 1609, Hudson journeyed up the New York river now named for him as far as what is now Albany. On his final voyage (1610), Hudson sailed for England in search of the Northwest Passage aboard the Discovery. After sailing between Baffin Island and Labrador (now called the Hudson Strait), he turned south into what is now called Hudson Bay. There, most of his crew mutinied under the leadership of Robert Juet. Hudson, his son, and some loyal crew members were placed in an open boat and left to die.\n\nJames Cook (1728–1779): On his first voyage (1768–1771), Captain Cook sailed aboard the Endeavour to observe the transit of the planet Venus from Tahiti. From there he went to New Zealand (discovering that it was two islands by sailing through what is now called the Cook Strait), then to Australia’s Botany Bay. On his second voyage (1772–1775), Cook sailed aboard the Resolution and became the first to cross the Antarctic Circle. On his third voyage (1776–1779), Cook failed to find the Northwest Passage and was killed when he came into conflict with the inhabitants of Hawaii.\n\nMeriwether Lewis (1774–1809) and William Clark (1770–1838): The Lewis and Clark expedition, also known as the Corps of Discovery, departed from Camp Wood (near St. Louis) in 1804, sailing up the Missouri River. The group wintered at Fort Mandan in what is now North Dakota, where they met Sacajawea, the Shoshone wife of the fur trader Toussaint Charbonneau. The group’s last winter was spent at Fort Clatsop, along the Columbia River in Oregon near the Pacific."

    "title": "Chinese Dynasties",
    "content": "The Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BC) is the first Chinese dynasty attested from written records. Archaeological excavations at the ruins of Yin, near the modern city of Anyang, uncovered the remains of a Chinese civilization from the Bronze Age. Shang dynasty writings are found on “oracle bones,” pieces of ox bone or turtle shell that were heated to produce a pattern of cracks that supposedly foretold the future.\n\nThe Zhou “Joe” dynasty (1046–256 BC) were chariot warriors who overthrew the Shang dynasty. Although the Zhou ruled for nearly 800 years, during much of the time period real power lay in the hands of feudal lords. The sacking of the Zhou capital by barbarians in 771 BC marks the beginning of the Eastern Zhou and the Spring and Autumn Period (771 BC – 476 BC). During the Spring and Autumn Period, the Hundred Schools of Thought (including Confucianism) flourished, and Sun Tzu wrote his Art of War. The end of the Zhou era devolved into the Warring States period (476 BC – 221 BC), during which power coalesced into seven independent feudal states. The state of Qin eventually grew powerful and efficient enough that it was able to defeat the other six states and complete the unification of China.\n\nThe Qin “chin” dynasty (221–206 BC), despite its short duration, is usually considered the origin of many of the institutions of imperial China. The founding emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi (usually shorted as Qin Shi Huang), has gained an ill-deserved reputation in traditional Chinese historiography because he destroyed many Confucian texts in his infamous book burning. Qin Shi Huang also standardized weight measurements, unified the Chinese script, and used conscripts to build the Great Wall. After his death, the suicide of the crown prince led to a period of incompetent rule and revolts that caused the collapse of the Qin dynasty.\n\nThe Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220) is considered a golden age of Chinese civilization; its influence was so great that the majority ethnic group in China is still called the Han. Its founder, Liu Bang (later Emperor Gaozu), was born a peasant. Through resourceful recruitment of talented followers and strategic violation of ceasefire agreement with his rival Xiang Yu, Liu Bang managed to reunite China and established his capital at Chang’an (modern Xi’an). Instability in the early years of the Han dynasty was caused by the depredations of the nomadic Xiongnu, a problem that was solved by its seventh emperor, Wudi. Emperor Wu, considered one of the greatest rulers of China, began a war of conquest against the Xiongnu and greatly expanded China’s frontiers. He also formalized China’s bureaucracy, sent envoys like Zhang Qian to Central Asia, and established Confucianism as the official state doctrine. Despite his success, his campaigns drained the treasury and his successors were unable to maintain the land he conquered. After a series of poor rulers, the Wang family — who claimed legitimacy through wives of various emperors — and their leader Wang Mang toppled the Han dynasty. Wang Mang established the Xin (meaning “new”) dynasty and attempted to restore the ways of the Zhou dynasty, but he was unable to maintain power because of a catastrophic changing of the course of the Yellow River, which spawned peasant protest movements like the Red Eyebrows. Eventually, a scion of the Liu family — Liu Xiu — restored the Han dynasty, moving the capital to Luoyang and establishing the Eastern Han. Subsequent rebellions called the Yellow Turbans and the Five Pecks of Rice hastened the end of the Han dynasty.\n\nThe short and turbulent period of the Three Kingdoms (AD 184–280) has had an enormous cultural impact thanks to the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. After a period of disunion, the lands of the former Han dynasty coalesced into three kingdoms: Cao Wei north of the Yangtze, Eastern Wu in the lower Yangtze, and Shu Han in the Sichuan region. The Battle of Red Cliffs (AD 208) was fought during this period. Under the leadership of the Sima family, Cao Wei managed to defeat the other two kingdoms. The reunification was, however, short-lived. For the next four centuries, China went through a period known as the Southern and Northern Dynasties.\n\nThe Tang dynasty (618–907) is considered another golden age of Chinese culture: during the Tang period, important poets such as Li Bai (or Li Po) and Du Fu lived, and the printing press was invented. The Tang dynasty reunited China after the collapse of the short-lived Sui dynasty, was ruled by the Li family, and had its capital at Chang’an (modern day Xi’an). Its first ruler, like the founder of the Han Dynasty, used the title of Emperor Gaozu. Gaozu was forced by his second son, Li Shimin (later Emperor Taizong), to abdicate after Li Shimin killed two of his brothers in an ambush. Despite his bloody path to power, Taizong is considered to be one of the greatest rulers in Chinese history, subjugating much of what is now western China and parts of central Asia. After his death, power came to be concentrated in the hands of Empress Wu. Empress Wu (or Wu Zetian) was the only woman to become emperor of China, and called her rule the “Second Zhou dynasty.” Wu was a notable supporter of Buddhism and promoted the imperial examination, but succession troubles resulted in the premature end of her dynasty. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, the An Lushan rebellion (also called the An Shi rebellion) wrecked the foundations of the Tang dynasty. Although it was suppressed, the An Lushan rebellion concentrated power in the hands of regional military overlords. The dynasty had a tumultuous end in 907 that marked the beginning of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.\n\nThe Song dynasty (960–1279) is known for its devotion to cultural activities instead of warfare and for the establishment of Neo-Confucianism as state doctrine, with the imperial examination as the primary way of recruiting talent. It was also during the Song dynasty that gunpowder and the compass were discovered. The Song dynasty, even in its early years, could not rule all of China proper and was forced to relinquish parts of northern China to the “barbarian” Liao dynasty, paying tribute for peace. Although like most dynasties, it began as the ventures of a military leader, its first ruler, Taizu, realized that his rival generals could take power from him. He then induced all his major commanders to retire, setting up the dominance of the scholarly elite over the military elite throughout the Song dynasty. This policy was continued by his successors. In the north, however, the Liao dynasty was eventually replaced by the militaristic Jin dynasty, who captured the Song capital, Kaifeng along with two Emperors. The remnants of the court fled across the Yangtze and established the Southern Song with a new capital at Hangzhou, maintaining peace with the Jin through annual tribute. This state of affairs was brought to an end after the Song dynasty aided the Mongols in crushing the Jin, only to discover that they themselves were the next target. Despite the might of the Mongol war machine, the Song dynasty managed to repel major Mongol offensives for nearly 40 years, before it was finally defeated.\n\nThe Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) was a short-lived dynasty established by the invading Mongols, who destroyed the Jin and Song states. Its most notable ruler was Kublai Khan, whose invasions of Japan were thwarted by typhoons that the Japanese called the kamikaze, or “divine wind.” Yuan rulers were hostile to many Chinese institutions, and thus received minimal support from the Chinese elites. The Red Turban rebellion of the 1350s marked the beginning of the end for the Yuan.\n\nThe Ming dynasty (1368–1644) was the last native dynasty of China; its rulers came from the Zhu family. The use of the word “china” to describe fine porcelain originated from this period, as the Ming were well-known for producing high-quality porcelain. Its founding ruler, Zhu Yuanzhang (Emperor Hongwu), was a peasant leader of the Red Turbans who helped expel the Mongol Yuan rulers from China. He was succeeded by his grandson, who quickly lost power to Zhu Di (Emperor Yongle). During the reign of the Yongle emperor, the eunuch Zheng He led treasure fleets on seven voyages to display Chinese greatness. Zhu Di moved China’s capital to Beijing. After his death, the Ming dynasty banned maritime commerce, which left the dynasty vulnerable to pirates. The Ming dynasty came to an end after the rebellion of Li Zicheng, which was caused by inadequate government response to inflation, famine, and floods. Simultaneously, the Manchu people — tributaries of the Ming from northeast China in what is now Manchuria — marched on the Great Wall. The Manchus suppressed Li Zicheng’s revolt and took power in Beijing themselves.\n\nThe invading Manchus established the Qing cheeng dynasty (1644–1911), the last dynasty to rule imperial China. An important institution of the Qing dynasty was the banner system, which acted as a guaranteed welfare system for Manchus and gave them benefits in the imperial examination (positions were often duplicated, with one Han Chinese and one Manchu from the banners). The foundations of the Qing dynasty were established under its second ruler, the Kangxi Emperor, who put down the Revolt of the Three Feudatories. He is also famous for the Kangxi dictionary, which is known for popularizing the system of Chinese radicals. During the last century of Qing rule, China was weakened both by foreign attacks (the Opium Wars against Britain) and internal dissent (the devastating Taiping Rebellion of 1850–1864). Attempts to modernize Qing rule (the Self-Strengthening Movement and the Hundred Days’ Reform of 1898) proved inconclusive. Qing Dowager Express Cixi, who opposed the reformers, was implicated in the Boxer Rebellion, an anti-foreign uprising of 1900 that caused eight Western nations to send military forces to Beijing. China’s last emperor was Puyi, who came to the throne at the age of two in 1906. The 1911 Xinhai Revolution ended the Qing Dynasty and created the Republic of China."

    "title": "Distinctions Among Types Of Plants",
    "content": "Bryophytes vs. pterophytes: Not all plants produce seeds. Seedless plants are divided into bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts) and pterophytes (ferns, club mosses, quillworts, and horsetails). Both of these groups, like all other plants, reproduce by producing sperm and eggs on a structure called the gametophyte. The gametes fuse to form another structure called the sporophyte, which produces spores that disperse and grow into new gametophytes. Both groups produce flagellated sperm that require water for fertilization. Note that these uses of “bryophyte” and “pterophyte” here are informal, and should not be confused with the actual phyla Bryophyta (true mosses) and Pteridophyta (true ferns). Bryophytes are small enough that water and nutrients can diffuse to all parts of the plant without any specialized vascular tissue. They lack true leaves and roots, instead fastening themselves to the ground with rhizoids. Unlike other land plants, bryophytes have a prominent gametophyte stage that is usually dioicous, meaning that an individual plant produces only one type of gamete (either sperm or egg). The short-lived sporophyte grows from the female gametophyte. The more complex pterophytes can grow taller thanks to vascular tissues (see number 4 below) that provide structural support and transport water and other materials throughout the plant. Many of them do have true leaves and roots. Pterophytes have a prominent sporophyte stage that grows from a small, short-lived gametophyte. Pterophyte gametophytes may be dioicous or monoicous, producing both sperm and egg on the same plant.\n\nAngiosperms vs. gymnosperms: Seed-producing plants can be divided into gymnosperms (cycads, ginkgos, conifers, and gnetophytes) and angiosperms (phylum Anthophyta, or flowering plants). Most of these plants produce male gametophytes that grow into the female, allowing fertilization to take place in relatively dry conditions. Many of them also exhibit secondary growth of woody tissues, allowing them to grow even taller than the pterophytes. The word gymnosperm means “naked seed,” referring to the fact that their gametophytes develop on the surface of leaves or on the scales of cones. In contrast, angiosperm means “receptacle seed.” Their gametophytes develop enclosed within flowers. Angiosperms are further classified based on their seed structure, described below.\n\nMonocots vs. dicots: Most (but not all) angiosperms fall into one of two classes based on the number of cotyledons, or embryonic seed-leaves, in the plant embryo. Monocots, or Monocotyledonae, have one cotyledon, while dicots, or Dicotyledonae, have two. While there are no other hard-and-fast distinguishing characteristics between the two groups, plants in each category tend to share other characteristics: Monocots produce pollen grains that have a single furrow (monosulcate); flower parts in multiples of three; numerous, fibrous roots; parallel leaf veins; and stems with scattered vascular bundles. They also lack secondary growth, remaining herbaceous throughout their lives. Dicots, on the other hand, tend to have pollen with three furrows (tricolpate); flower parts in multiples of four or greater; taproot systems; stems with rings of vascular tissue; and branching leaf veins. Many of them exhibit secondary growth that produces wood.\n\nXylem vs. phloem: There are two types of vascular tissue in plants. Xylem transports water and soluble nutrients from the roots to the leaves. Phloem, on the other hand, carries nutrients like sucrose from their origin of synthesis or absorption to all parts of the plant. Both tissues originate in the procambium of the apical meristems of both the stems and roots. In woody plants, secondary vascular tissues arise in the vascular cambium. Xylem contains distinct elongated cells called tracheids that have lignified cell walls and help provide structural support. Vessel elements are also reinforced by lignin, but they are open at each end at perforation plates and connect to form long tubes for water transport. Xylem functions via transpirational pull and osmosis. Cell types in phloem include companion cells, fibers, and sclereids. In trees, it is usually the innermost layer of the bark.\n\nFlower parts: The calyx is composed of sepals, specialized green leaves that protect the flower as a bud and provide support for the fully bloomed flower The stem supporting a flower is called the peduncle. If multiple flowers bloom from a peduncle, the stems supporting each flower are called pedicels. The torus is the swelling at the top of the pedicel or peduncle, just below the calyx. Petals are specialized leaves, often brightly colored to attract pollinating species. Collectively, they are called a corolla. The pollen-producing reproductive organ of the flower is called the stamen. The stamen consists of a thin filament topped by an anther, which actually contains the pollen. The pistil, or female reproductive organ of the flower, is composed of leaf-like carpels. The ovary-containing ovules are at the base of the pistil, while a tube called a style topped by a sticky, pollen-receptive stigma rises from the ovary. There may be one or many pistils in each flower."

    "title": "British Prime Ministers",
    "content": "Robert Walpole (1676–1745, PM 1721–1742): Generally recognized as the first British Prime Minister, Walpole established personal control over a Whig-dominated Parliament on behalf of the German-speaking George I. He rose to power after many rivals were tarnished by the collapse of the South Sea Company. His long tenure continued under George II, but his attempts to avoid British military commitments worldwide led to his downfall during the War of the Austrian Succession.\n\nRobert Peel (1788–1850, PM 1834–1835, 1841–1846): Set out the founding principles of the Conservative Party in the Tamworth Manifesto and led the new party to its first general election victory. The Irish Famine accelerated his decision to repeal the Corn Laws, promoting free trade by removing grain tariffs. This act was achieved with Whig support and lost him the backing of his party.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli (1804–1881, PM 1868, 1874–1880): Before becoming Prime Minister, Disraeli was instrumental in the passage of the Second Reform Act as leader of the House of Commons. Britain’s only Prime Minister of Jewish descent, Disraeli was also a successful novelist. He promoted a strong, imperial foreign policy including investment in the Suez Canal and the peace achieved at the Congress of Berlin.\n\nWilliam Gladstone (1809–1898, PM 1868–1874, 1880–1885, 1886, 1892–1894): Noted Liberal Prime Minister who passed a Third Reform Act and modernized the military, but failed to achieve Irish Home Rule. Queen Victoria loathed him. During Disraeli’s ministry Gladstone’s campaign sensationalized the “Bulgarian horrors,” suggesting that Britain needed to resolve the “Eastern Question” about the fate of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nH. H. Asquith (1852–1928, PM 1908–1916): Liberal Prime Minister who made sweeping reforms, including limiting the power of the unelected House of Lords with the Parliament Act in order to introduce the “People’s Budget” of 1911, which established state pensions. Not a successful wartime leader, Asquith lost control of a coalition government during World War I and was forced to resign in favor of David Lloyd George.\n\nDavid Lloyd George (1863–1945, PM 1916–1922): A native Welsh speaker who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Asquith. Taking control during World War I, he represnted the U.K. at the Paris Peace Conference, leading to the Treaty of Versailles. After the war he split the Liberal Party by aiming to continue the coalition government together with the Conservative Bonar Law; the coalition collapsed after embarrassment over the independence of Ireland and a scandal over the sale of honors.\n\nWinston Churchill (1874–1965, PM 1940–1945, 1951–1955): Best remembered as the U.K.’s wartime prime minister from the country’s isolation in 1940 to victory in 1945. The son of a major Conservative politician, Randolph Churchill, the young Winston Churchill was a Liberal who served in Asquith’s cabinet, becoming First Lord of the Admiralty before resigning over the failure of Gallipoli. As Stanley Baldwin’s (PM 1923–1924, 1924–1929, 1935–1937) Chancellor of the Exchequer he put the U.K. on the gold standard. Winning a second term as Prime Minister during the Korean War, in later life he also won the Nobel Prize for Literature and wrote A History of the English-Speaking Peoples.\n\nClement Attlee (1883–1967, PM 1945–1950): Won a huge Labour landslide victory in 1945 between the end of the war in Europe and victory in Japan. He founded the modern welfare state based on the Beveridge Report, including the National Health Service under his minister Nye Bevan. Attlee’s Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, took the U.K. out of Palestine and sent troops to the Korean War.\n\nMargaret Thatcher (1925–2013, PM 1979–1990): The U.K.’s first female prime minister was known as the “Iron Lady.” Thatcher’s divisive 1980s Conservative premiership saw the collapse of British heavy industry and its replacement by a services-based economy, especially focused on banking. Re-elected in 1983 after winning the Falklands War, she clashed with the mine workers’ leader Arthur Scargill as well as her right-hand man Michael Heseltine, and after losing popularity due to a poll tax was ousted by her own party in favor of John Major (PM 1990–1997).\n\nTony Blair (1953–, PM 1997–2007): Won a famous landslide election victory in 1997 to end 18 years of Conservative rule as his “New Labour” movement abandoned traditional socialism and moved the Labour Party to the center. Re-elected in 2001 and 2005, his friendship and later enmity towards his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown (PM 2007–2010) ended with Brown succeeding him as Prime Minister. Blair’s close relationship with George W. Bush led to the U.K. joining the invasion of Iraq in 2003; his domestic legacy was higher public spending and the devolution of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nWilliam Pitt the Younger (PM 1783–1801, 1804–1806) strengthened the role of the Prime Minister and pursued war against revolutionary France.\n\nLord Liverpool (PM 1812–1827) was Prime Minister at the time of victory at the Battle of Waterloo, and faced social turmoil, including the Peterloo Massacre of protesters in Manchester.\n\nLord Palmerston (PM 1855–1858, 1859–1865): was a long-serving Secretary of State and the first Prime Minister of the Liberal Party that succeeded the Whigs. He kept Britain neutral during the American Civil War.\n\nNeville Chamberlain (PM 1937–1940) signed the Munich Agreement with Adolf Hitler, and promised “peace for our time” with a policy of appeasement. British military failures in 1940 led to his replacement by Churchill.\n\nHarold Macmillan (PM 1957–1963) said “you’ve never had it so good” as the British economy recovered in the late 1950s. Later he purged his cabinet in a mass sacking dubbed the “Night of the Long Knives” (no relation to the 1934 executions in Nazi Germany).\n\nDavid Cameron (PM 2010–2016) led a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government and favored austerity economics and the elimination of the U.K.’s fiscal deficit. He resigned after the Brexit vote in 2016."

    "title": "Musicals (Part 2)",
    "content": "The Music Man (Meredith Wilson and Franklin Lacey, 1957): The swindler Harold Hill attempts to con the families of River City, Iowa by starting a boys’ band. While there, he falls in love with the librarian Marian Paroo. The scheme is exposed, but the town forgives him. Notable songs include “Trouble” (the origin of the phrase “trouble in River City”), “Seventy-Six Trombones,” “Shipoopi,” “Gary, Indiana,” and “Till There was You.”\n\nRent (Jonathan Larson, 1996): Rent tells the story of impoverished artists (“bohemians”) living in the East Village of New York City during the AIDS crisis circa 1990 (though the temporal references are inconsistent, so no specific year can be pinned down). It is narrated by the filmmaker Mark Cohen, whose ex-girlfriend Maureen just left him for a woman (Joanne), and whose recovering-heroin-addict roommate Roger meets the dying stripper (and fellow heroin addict) Mimi. Mark and Roger’s former roommate, the itinerant philosopher and hacker Collins comes to town, where he is robbed, then saved by the transvestite Angel, with whom he moves in. Meanwhile, the former fourth roommate of Mark, Roger, and Collins — Benny — has married into a wealthy family and bought the building Mark and Roger now live in, from which he wants to evict them. The title refers to both the rent money that Mark and Roger cannot and will not pay Benny, and to their community being rent apart (torn) by the AIDS epidemic, poverty, and drug addiction. Rent is an adaptation of Giacomo Puccini’s opera La bohème (with most characters corresponding directly, e.g. Mark to Marcello). It won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and is most famous for the songs “Seasons of Love” and “La Vie Bohème”.\n\nGuys and Dolls (Frank Loesser, Jo Swerling, and Abe Burrows, 1950): Nathan Detroit runs an underground craps game but needs a location. To make enough money to use the Biltmore garage for his game, he bets the notorious gambler Sky Masterson that Sky can’t convince a girl of Nathan’s choice to go to Havana with him for dinner; Nathan chooses the righteous missionary Sarah Brown. Sky wins the bet but ends up having to bring a dozen sinning gamblers to a revival meeting. As Nathan attends the meeting, his long-suffering fiancée Adelaide, a nightclub dancer, is increasingly frustrated that their 14-year engagement has not led to marriage. At the meeting, Sky bets a large amount of money against the gamblers’ souls, winning, and eventually convinces Sarah to marry him and Nathan to marry Adelaide. Adapted from short stories by Damon Runyon, the musical includes the songs “A Bushel and a Peck,” “Luck Be a Lady,” and “Sit Down, You’re Rockin’ the Boat.”\n\nLes Misérables (Alain Boublil, Claude-Michel Schönberg, and Herbert Kretzmer, 1985): A partial retelling of the Victor Hugo novel of the same name, this work follows Jean Valjean, who was convicted of stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving niece. He breaks his parole and is doggedly pursued by Inspector Javert. Several years later, the lives of Valjean, his adopted daughter Cosette, her lover Marius and his unrequited admirer Éponine, and Javert become intertwined on the barricades of an 1832 student rebellion in Paris. The longest-running show on London’s West End, it features the songs “I Dreamed a Dream,”, “Castle on a Cloud,” “Master of the House,” “Do You Hear the People Sing?”, “One Day More,” and “On My Own.”\n\nAnnie Get Your Gun (Irving Berlin, Herbert Fields, and Dorothy Fields, 1946): Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show comes to town, and performer Frank Butler challenges anyone to a shooting contest. Annie Oakley wins the contest and joins the show. She and Frank fall in love, but Frank quits out of jealousy that Annie is a better shooter than he is. The title role was originated by Ethel Merman. The show includes the songs “There’s No Business Like Show Business,” “Doin’ What Comes Natur’lly,” and “Anything You Can Do.”\n\nThe Pirates of Penzance (W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, 1879): Frederic, having turned 21, is released from his apprenticeship to the title pirates. Reaching shore for the first time, Frederic falls in love with Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley. Frederic realizes that he was apprenticed until his twenty-first birthday, and, having been born on February 29, he must return to his apprenticeship. Mabel vows to wait for him. The Major-General and the police pursue the pirates, who surrender. The pirates are forgiven, and Mabel and Frederic reunite. As the work is actually a light opera, most of the songs are simply titled after their first lines; the most memorable ones include “Pour, oh pour, the pirate sherry” and the patter song “I am the very model of a modern Major-General.”\n\nH.M.S. Pinafore (W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, 1878): Aboard the title ship, Josephine promises her father, the captain, that she will marry Sir Joseph Porter, but Josephine secretly loves the common sailor Ralph Rackstraw, and the two plan to elope. A peddler named Buttercup reveals that she accidentally switched the captain and Ralph at birth: Ralph is of noble birth and should be captain, while the captain is nothing more than a common sailor. Ralph, now captain, marries Josephine, and the former captain marries Buttercup. Like The Pirates of Penzance, songs are named after their first lines; they include “We sail the ocean blue,” “I’m called Little Buttercup,” and “Pretty daughter of mine.”\n\nThe King and I (Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, 1951): Anna Leonowens, a British schoolteacher, travels to Siam (now Thailand) to teach English to the King’s many children and wives. Anna’s western ways, the looming threat of British rule, and romance between Lun Tha and the concubine Tuptim all weigh heavily on the traditional, chauvinistic King. As the King dies, Anna kneels at his side, and the prince abolishes the practice of kowtowing. Adapted from Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon and inspired by Anna Leonowens’ memoirs, it was made into an Academy Award-winning 1956 film starring Yul Brynner. Its songs include “I Whistle a Happy Tune,” “Getting to Know You,” and “Shall We Dance?”.\n\nJesus Christ Superstar (Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, 1971): In the week leading up to the crucifixion, Judas grows angry with Christ’s claims of divinity, and Mary Magdalene laments her romantic feelings for Christ. Judas hangs himself, and Christ, though frustrated with God, accepts his fate. It includes the songs “I Don’t Know How to Love Him,” “Gethsemane,” and “Trial Before Pilate.”\n\nSweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler, 1979): Sweeney Todd, a barber, returns to London from Australia, where the evil Judge Turpin — who lusted after Sweeney’s wife — unjustly imprisoned him. Sweeney’s daughter, Joanna, escapes Turpin — of whom she had been a ward during her father’s incarceration — and falls in love with the sailor Anthony Hope. A vengeful Sweeney begins murdering his customers, and his neighbor, Mrs. Lovett, bakes them into meat pies. Sweeney kills the Judge but, in his fury, accidentally kills a mad beggar woman who was really his long-lost wife. Mrs. Lovett’s shop boy, Tobias, grows scared and kills Sweeney. The show’s famously complex score includes “The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,” “The Worst Pies in London,” “Johanna,” and “God, That’s Good,”, but since the show is essentially sung-through, it is sometimes nontrivial to identify distinct songs within it.\n\nSouth Pacific (Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Joshua Logan, 1949): During the Pacific Theater of World War II, Nellie Forbush, a U.S. Navy nurse, has fallen in love with Émile, a French plantation owner. Émile helps Lieutenant Cable carry out an espionage mission against the Japanese. The mission is successful, and Émile and Nellie reunite. Featuring the songs “Some Enchanted Evening,” “There is Nothing Like a Dame,” and “I’m Gonna Wash that Man Right Outta My Hair,” it is adapted from James Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific."

    "title": "Music Theory Terms",
    "content": "Tempo: Traditionally, the tempo, or speed, of a piece is indicated through the use of Italian-language terms. Some of the most common tempo markings are largo (very slow), adagio (slow), andante (“walking speed”), allegro (fast), and presto (very fast). A work’s tempo may also be indicated by a metronome marking, which indicates the number of a certain type of note per minute (e.g., quarter note = 120). Tempos are often modified with further Italian terms, such as allegro con fuoco (fast, with fire), which can make them more unique. Movements from larger works are often referred to by their tempo (e.g. “the Allegretto from Beethoven’s 7th symphony”); entire works may also be named for their tempo (e.g., Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings).\n\nScales: The two most common types of scales are the major and minor scales, both of which are referred to as diatonic, meaning that they have seven notes between octaves and follow a repeating pattern of whole steps and half steps. While there is only one major scale, there are three common variants of the minor scale: natural, harmonic, and melodic. The individual notes within a scale are given numeric indications known as scale degrees, starting with “1” and moving up the scale note by note; the most prominent of these are the first degree, or tonic (the “home” pitch), and the fifth degree, or dominant. There is also the chromatic scale, which includes every note between two endpoints, including sharps and flats.\n\nIntervals: At the most basic level, intervals — the distance between two pitches — are described with ordinal numbers (second, third, etc.), with the exceptions of unisons (two of the exact same note, which would logically have been called a “first”) and octaves (which would have been called an “eighth”). The easiest way to find the basic interval between two pitches is to start on the bottom pitch, label that line or space “1,” and then count lines and spaces upwards until the next pitch is reached; for example, the interval between C and F is a fourth: C is counted as “1,” the lines/spaces for D and E are counted as “2” and “3,” and the line/space for F is reached on “4.” Unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves may be classified as perfect, augmented, or diminished; seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths may be classified as major, minor, augmented, or diminished.\n\nChords: The most common types of chords are built of successive notes that are each a third above the previous. A triad consists of three notes referred to as the root, third, and fifth—the third and fifth being that respective interval above the root. Triads are classified as either major, minor, augmented, or diminished, based on whether the successive pitches are separated by major or minor thirds. Adding another third above the fifth results in a seventh chord (since that new pitch is a seventh above the root). Although many types of seventh chords are possible, the most common are the major, major-minor (or dominant), minor, half-diminished, and fully-diminished. Larger chords, such as ninth and thirteenth chords, appear commonly in jazz.\n\nKey: A piece of music’s key is the “home” scale of the work. The key is most often indicated by the work’s key signature, a collection of sharps or flats that appears at the beginning of the work and on each subsequent line of music (a list of key signatures may be found here). A pair of keys may be parallel (beginning on the same pitch, e.g., C major and C minor), or relative (having the same key signature, e.g., C major and A minor). Most works of music between the Baroque and Romantic periods end in the same key as they begin, with the exception that works that start in a minor key may end in the parallel major. A work’s key is often used as a descriptor in its title (e.g. Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 in C minor).\n\nTransposition: Instruments that are in concert pitch, or “in C,” have their music written at the same pitch in which they sound. Concert pitch instruments include the piano, all string instruments, the flute, and nearly every woodwind and brass instrument that plays in bass clef. Other instruments are transposing instruments, meaning that their music is written at a different pitch than they sound. With few exceptions, music for transposing instruments is written above the sounding pitch, which can be determined by moving down the interval that the instrument’s key is below C. For example, the French horn is in F, a perfect fifth below C; thus, a French horn playing a written G natural would sound a C natural, the pitch a perfect fifth below G natural. Similarly, a B-flat trumpet playing a written D would sound a C, a major second below.\n\nDynamics: Dynamic markings indicate the volume at which music is to be played. The two most basic dynamic markings are forte, meaning “loud,” and abbreviated f; and piano, meaning “soft,” and abbreviated p. These indications are often modified by the word mezzo (abbreviated m); thus, mf indicates “mezzo forte,” meaning “medium loud.” They may also be modified by the suffix -issimo, meaning “very,” and symbolized by two of the same letter; thus, pp would indicate pianissimo, meaning “very soft.” Gradual changes in volume are indicated by a crescendo, meaning gradually getting louder, or a diminuendo (also called decrescendo), meaning gradually getting softer.\n\nArticulation: Articulation refers to the various techniques which may be used to modify the attack or performance of a single note or a series of notes. Some of the most common articulations include staccato, meaning light or short; tenuto, meaning a note is to be held its entire value; and legato, meaning a series of notes is to be connected to one another very smoothly. Single notes may be given extra force by an accent mark.\n\nForm: A work’s form, or overall structure, is often depicted via a series of capital letters, with each different letter representing a large section of contrasting material. Basic forms include binary form (“AB” or “AABB”), ternary form (“ABA”), and strophic form (“A” endlessly repeated, commonly found in folk songs or religious hymns with multiple verses). Other forms include rondo form, in which several statements of a single theme are each separated by contrasting material (e.g. “ABACA”). Forms not usually represented by capital letters include the various types of theme and variations, as well as sonata-allegro form (which at its most basic level includes an exposition, a development, and a recapitulation).\n\nTwelve-tone technique: Twelve-tone technique was developed by Arnold Schoenberg in the early 1920s, and is one method of writing atonal music—music that has no key or tonic pitch. Twelve-tone works are based on a tone row constructed from each of the twelve pitches of the chromatic scale, each used only once. This row may be inverted and/or presented in retrograde (backwards), a combination of possibilities often represented in a twelve-tone matrix (for an example, see here; curious readers may experiment with creating their own row/matrix here). Twelve-tone technique is one form of serialism, the rigid structuring of various musical elements within a work. A work of total serialism applies the same process to dynamics, articulations, and other basic elements of music as well as pitch."

    "title": "20th-century African Leaders",
    "content": "Idi Amin (Dada) was the president of Uganda from 1971 to 1979. He was a military leader who came to power in a coup when Prime Minister Milton Obote was out of the country. While in power, Amin encouraged death squads such as the Public Safety Unit and the State Research Bureau, and he has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths. In 1972 Amin expelled tens of thousands of Asians from Uganda. Amin allowed Palestinian hijackers to land a captured Air France plane at Entebbe Airport in 1976; Jewish hostages on board were freed by Operation Thunderbolt, an Israeli commando operation during which Yonatan Netanyahu, the older brother of the future Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was killed. A 1979 invasion by Tanzania forced Amin from power; he fled to exile in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMuammar al-Gaddafi was the leader of Libya from 1969 to 2011. Gaddafi’s Free Officers Movement, modeled after the Egyptian organization of the same name, overthrew King Idris I in 1969. The Little Green Book collects ideas and sayings associated with Gaddafi’s pan-Arabist ideology. The U.S. and Britain criticized his terrorist associations and blamed him for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland (the Lockerbie bombing) which killed 270 people. After a discotheque in Berlin was bombed in 1986, the U.S. attacked several sites in Libya. Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by supporters of the National Transitional Council during the Libyan Civil War in 2011.\n\nJomo Kenyatta, a leader of the Kikuyu people, fought against British control of Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion of the 1950s. Kenyatta studied anthropology at the London School of Economics with Bronisław Malinowski; his book, Facing Mount Kenya, is an account of traditional Kikuyu society under pressure from colonialism. When Britain allowed elections to take place, Kenyatta’s KANU (Kenya African National Union) party was successful; in 1964 Kenyatta became the country’s first president. He used the slogan “harambee,” which is Swahili for “all pull together,” to encourage national unity and economic growth. Jomo’s son, Uhuru Kenyatta, became Kenya’s fourth president in 2013.\n\nMobutu Sese Seko moh-BOO-too SAY-say SAY-koh (born Joseph Mobutu) came to power during the “Congo Crisis,” which resulted in the assassination of elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the death in a plane crash of United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld. Mobutu changed the name of his country from “Congo” to “Zaire” (it reverted to “Democratic Republic of the Congo” after his fall). Despite its atrocious human rights record, Mobutu’s regime was supported by the United States because Mobutu took an anti-Communist position during the Cold War. Rebels led by Laurent Kabila overthrew Mobutu in 1997.\n\nRobert Mugabe moo-GAH-bay became the first president of post-colonial Zimbabwe in 1980. Zimbabwe was the successor state to Rhodesia, the white-supremacist state in south-central Africa led by Ian Smith. Mugabe, the leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union, was a key figure in the civil and military struggle for African rights in Rhodesia. Mugabe’s regime came under increasing criticism for his failure to prevent hyperinflation and his suppression of political dissent. He resigned the presidency after a November 2017 coup and was replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nNelson Mandela was a leader of the African National Congress and the first democratically-elected president of South Africa. In the 1960s Mandela was a young radical; along with Oliver Tambo and others, he founded a militant group called Umkhonto we Sizwe (the “spear of the nation”) to carry out acts of sabotage against the apartheid government. In 1964 Mandela was charged with criminal activity in the Rivonia Trial; he was imprisoned for 27 years, most of them on Robben Island, a prison colony located off the coast of Cape Town. Mandela was the leading figure in South Africa’s transition away from apartheid; he and his predecessor, F. W. de Klerk, shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser was the leader of Egypt from 1954 until his death in 1970. He supported the Free Officers Movement, which was led by Muhammad Naguib and which overthrew King Farouk in 1952, but he then took power while accusing of Naguib of allying with the Muslim Brotherhood. Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956, leading to a confrontation with Britain, France, and Israel. From 1958 to 1961 Nasser served as president of the United Arab Republic, a short-lived federation of Egypt and Syria. Nasser was succeeded in 1970 by his ally Anwar Sadat.\n\nKwame Nkrumah KWAH-may en-KROOM-uh became the prime minister of the Gold Coast in 1952 and declared independence from Britain in 1957, renaming the country Ghana. He was the first African leader to declare independence from a colonial power. Nkrumah supported pan-Africanism, an ideology that proposed continent-wide cooperation and union of African peoples. His regime racked up large debts through military reform and the building of the Akosombo Dam to create Lake Volta. A 1966 coup ended Nkrumah’s rule over Ghana.\n\nJulius Nyerere was the leader of Tanganyika and then Tanzania from 1961 to 1985. (Tanzania was formed by the 1964 merger of Tanganyika with Zanzibar.) Tanganyika gained independence before Nyerere came to power due to negotiations between Nyerere and British Governor Richard Turnbull. Nyerere put forward his socialist plans in the Arusha Declaration of 1967. His policies were known by the term ujamaa, signifying family unity in Swahili. Under his leadership, literacy improved significantly, but poverty remained high, especially among rural laborers uprooted by Nyerere’s centralized economic planning. His Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or Party of the Revolution, remains as the dominant power in Tanzania politics.\n\nHaile Selassie “highly” seh-LASS-ee (birth name Tafari Makonnen) was the Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974. A 1936 invasion by fascist Italy forced Selassie to live in exile in England until 1941, when he was restored to the throne with the assistance of the British military. Many members of the Rastafarian movement consider Haile Selassie to be a sacred and messianic figure. Ethiopia suffered a severe famine in the early 1970s, and Selassie was overthrown in 1974. The military government that replaced him was known as the Derg."

    "title": "Works By Ludwig Van Beethoven",
    "content": "Symphony No. 5 in C minor, op. 67 (1804–1808): The iconic opening motif of the Fifth Symphony — a descending major third followed by a descending minor third, in a short-short-short-long rhythmic pattern — has become ubiquitous in popular culture, though the claim that it represents “fate knocking at the door” does not come from Beethoven himself. The work’s third movement, a scherzo and trio in C minor, ends on a G major chord that proceeds directly into a C major final movement; that finale features one of the first orchestral uses (though not the first orchestral use) of trombones. The Fifth was premiered as part of a concert that also included the premiere of the Sixth Symphony.\n\nSymphony No. 9 in D minor, “Choral”, op. 125 (1822–1824): Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony marks the first significant use of voices as part of a symphony, though they are only used in the final movement. The opening motif from the first movement reappears in altered form in a second movement scherzo, which itself is followed by a slow third movement that alternates between quadruple and triple time. The massive final movement, whose internal form closely resembles that of the entire symphony, utilizes both Friedrich Schiller’s “Ode to Joy” and original texts by Beethoven himself. A typical performance takes approximately 75 minutes; the fourth movement alone takes 25.\n\nSymphony No. 6 in F major, “Pastoral”, op. 68 (1802–1808): As the title implies, Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony is a programmatic depiction of rural scenes; it is the composer’s only truly programmatic symphony. The symphony’s five movements, rather than the traditional four, each include a short title or description of their content: “Awakening of cheerful feelings upon arrival in the country” (I), “Scene at the brook” (II), “Happy gathering of country folks” (III), “Thunderstorm” (IV), and “Happy and thankful feelings after the storm” (V). In the score for the second movement, Beethoven explicitly identifies several woodwind motifs as being based on bird calls.\n\nSymphony No. 3 in E-flat major, “Eroica”, op. 55 (1803–1804): Beethoven’s Third Symphony was composed during the first part of his middle stylistic period, often referred to as his “heroic decade.” Beethoven may have been influenced in the work’s composition by his personal confrontation with his growing deafness. The second movement is a solemn, C minor funeral march, while the finale is a playful set of variations on a melody Beethoven used in several other works. The composer originally intended to title the symphony “Bonaparte”; in a popular but possibly apocryphal story, Beethoven ripped the title page from the score upon hearing that Napoleon had declared himself emperor.\n\nFidelio, op. 72 (1805; revised 1806 and 1814): This work is Beethoven’s only opera. The libretto is by Joseph Sonnleithner, with revisions by Stephan von Breuning and Georg Treitschke. Leonore wishes to rescure her husband Florestan from the prison of the evil Pizarro; to do so, she disguises herself as a boy named Fidelio so that the jailer Rocco will hire her to help him, and thus grant her access to her husband. Beethoven struggled with his opera: he first presented it as a three-act work before cutting it to the present two-act form, and wrote four separate overtures. The opera utilizes some spoken (rather than sung) dialogue, and includes “O what joy,” a chorus sung by prisoners.\n\nMissa solemnis (in D major), op. 123 (1819–1823): Generically, a “missa solemnis” (“solemn mass”) is a setting of the Catholic liturgy on a more grand scale than a “missa brevis” (“short mass”). Although it uses the traditional text, Beethoven intended the work for concert performance rather than liturgical use. Beethoven became increasingly fascinated by the fugue during his third stylistic period; his Missa solemnis includes two immense examples that conclude the Gloria and Credo movements. The composer dedicated the work to his patron, the Austrian Archduke Rudolf. The Missa solemnis should not be confused with Beethoven’s earlier C major mass, op. 86 (1807).\n\nPiano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major, “Emperor,” op. 73 (1809–1810): The “Emperor” concerto, composed near the end of Beethoven’s “heroic decade,” is the last concerto of any type that he completed. Beethoven defies traditional concerto structure in the opening movement by placing the most significant solo material for the piano at the beginning of the movement, rather than near its end. Beethoven did not give the work its title; it was first dubbed “Emperor” by Johann Cramer, who first published the work in England. The “Emperor,” which was premiered by pianist Friedrich Schneider, is the only one of Beethoven’s piano concertos that the composer himself never performed publicly.\n\nPiano Sonata No. 14 in C sharp minor, quasi una Fantasia (“Moonlight”), op. 27 No. 2, (1801–1802): As with the “Emperor,” Beethoven did not give the “Moonlight” sonata its nickname; it was coined several years after the composer’s death by Ludwig Rellstab, who commented on the first movement’s resemblance to moonlight on Lake Lucerne. Beethoven’s score calls for the sustain pedal to be held down through the entirety of the first movement. Often overshadowed by the ubiquitous first movement is the violent third movement, a Presto agitato sonata-allegro form with an extended coda, which on a larger scale serves as a recapitulation for the entire sonata. Beethoven dedicated the sonata to Giulietta Guicciardi, his pupil.\n\nPiano Sonata No. 23 in F minor, “Appassionata,” op. 57 (1804–1806): Again, Beethoven had no hand in the popular title of this sonata: the “Appassionata” label was applied by a publisher some years after Beethoven’s death. The sonata begins ominously: a theme descends in open octaves to the lowest note of the contemporary piano before rising again in an arpeggio, immediately repeated a minor second higher. The second movement has no stable conclusion, instead directly leading to the third through the use of a diminished seventh chord. The final movement’s coda, which itself introduces new thematic material, is one of the most demanding and difficult passages in all of the composer’s repertoire.\n\nWellington’s Victory; or, the Battle of Vitoria, op. 91 (1813): Also commonly known as the “Battle Symphony.” This heavily programmatic work was originally written for the panharmonicon, an automated orchestra; Beethoven later revised the work for live performers. The work utilizes several familiar melodies — including “God Save the Queen,” “Rule Britannia,” and “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow” — and calls for special effects such as musket fire. The work is generally regarded as one of Beethoven’s worst; even the composer himself acknowledged it as being a money-maker rather than serious art. Note that the piece specifically does not depict Wellington’s victory over Napoleon at Waterloo."

    "title": "North American Rivers",
    "content": "The Mississippi River is the longest or second-longest in North America, depending on how you count. (The Missouri River could be considered longer.) Referred to by Abraham Lincoln as “the father of waters,” the Mississippi begins at Lake Itasca, Minnesota, and flows 2,340 miles to a vast delta on the Gulf of Mexico, forming portions of ten state borders and the world’s third-largest drainage basin. The Mississippi picks up numerous major tributaries including the Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Arkansas, and Red Rivers, and flows past numerous major cities, including Minneapolis, St. Louis, Memphis, and New Orleans.\n\nThe Colorado River is the most significant river of the southwestern United States. Beginning in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, the Colorado River runs southwest for 1,450 miles to the Gulf of California in northwestern Mexico. The Colorado formed numerous canyons along much of its length, most notably the Grand Canyon in Arizona. The Colorado also has significant dams, including Hoover Dam near Las Vegas (forming Lake Mead) and Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona (forming Lake Powell).\n\nThe Ohio River flows 981 miles through a significant industrial region of the central United States. Historically seen as the border between the northern and southern United States, the Ohio is formed in downtown Pittsburgh by the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, flowing past Wheeling, Cincinnati, Louisville, and Evansville, forming borders of five states before emptying into the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois. Other major tributaries of the Ohio include the Kanawha, Kentucky, Tennessee, Wabash, and Cumberland Rivers.\n\nThe Columbia River is a vital waterway of the Pacific Northwest. Rising in the Rockies of British Columbia, the Columbia flows through Lake Revelstoke before entering Washington state. Grand Coulee Dam along the Columbia in Washington forms Lake Roosevelt. When it was completed in 1943, Grand Coulee was the largest hydroelectric plant in the world; it is still America’s largest electric power plant. The Columbia receives the Yakima and Snake Rivers before forming much of the Washington-Oregon border, receiving the Willamette River in Portland before emptying into the Pacific where Lewis and Clark sighted the ocean.\n\nThe St. Lawrence River drains the Great Lakes and serves as a major waterway of eastern Canada. First explored and named by Jacques Cartier in the early 16th century, the St. Lawrence emerges from the northeastern corner of Lake Ontario in the Thousand Islands archipelago, forming the border between Ontario and New York. The St. Lawrence receives the Ottawa and Saguenay Rivers and flows through Montréal and Quebec City. At its mouth, the Gulf of St. Lawrence is one of the world’s largest estuaries.\n\nThe Hudson River has been a historically significant American river since the early 17th century. Named for the English explorer Henry Hudson, it flows 315 miles through eastern New York state. After receiving the Mohawk River, the Hudson flows past New York’s capital, Albany, and West Point before forming the boundary between Manhattan and New Jersey. The Hudson is also culturally significant as an inspiration for Washington Irving and the Hudson River School of American landscape painters.\n\nThe Missouri River is formed in western Montana by the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin Rivers. It flows past Bismarck, North Dakota and Kansas City before emptying into the Mississippi just north of St. Louis. Lewis and Clark used the Missouri as a route for exploration of the Louisiana Purchase. The Missouri is regulated by a number of major dams, including Fort Peck in Montana and Oahe Dam in South Dakota.\n\nThe Red River of the South is a major river of the southern Great Plains. The Red River forms most of the border between Oklahoma and Texas along its 1,360-mile length. That border formed part of the border between Mexico (and later the Republic of Texas) and the United States after the 1819 Adams-Onís Treaty. The Red runs through the Louisiana cities Shreveport and Alexandria before emptying into the Mississippi south of Natchez, Mississippi.\n\nThe Mackenzie River is the longest river of Canada. Flowing 1,080 miles out of the Great Slave Lake, the river flows past Fort Providence and Fort Simpson in Canada’s Northwest Territories, emptying into a vast delta on the Beaufort Sea. The Mackenzie is the largest river flowing into the Arctic Ocean from North America. The river was named for Scottish explorer Alexander Mackenzie, who crossed Canada to the Pacific ten years before Lewis and Clark.\n\nThe Snake River is a major river of the northwestern United States. Rising in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake bisects southern Idaho along its 1,078-mile route. Flowing through Pocatello and Boise, the Snake River forms much of the border between Idaho and Oregon, including the famous Hells Canyon. The Snake River was a vital route for travelers headed west on the Oregon Trail, who followed the river most of the way to its mouth on the Columbia River.\n\nThe Delaware River is a historically significant river of the eastern United States. From its source in the Catskills, the Delaware flows 301 miles, forming the border between Delaware and New Jersey. The Delaware flows past Trenton, New Jersey and Philadelphia, where it receives the Schuylkill River before emptying into the Atlantic. George Washington crossed the Delaware on Christmas night in 1776 to surprise the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton.\n\nThe Potomac River is one of America’s most historic waterways. Rising at Fairfax Stone in West Virginia, the Potomac runs 405 miles, forming the border between Virginia and Maryland. Washington, D.C. was sited on the Potomac at its confluence with the Anacostia River. George Washington’s plantation Mount Vernon was on the Potomac, while Robert E. Lee’s two invasions north of the Potomac were major events of the Civil War.\n\nThe Rio Grande has formed the border between Texas and four Mexican states since 1848. It flows south out of Colorado through New Mexico before reaching the international boundary near El Paso. Texas’s Big Bend National Park is named for the sweeping curve the Rio Grande cuts through the Sierra Madre Oriental. After leaving the mountains, the river flows past Laredo and Brownsville before it empties into the Gulf of Mexico."

    "title": "Feminists",
    "content": "Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797) Wollstonecraft was a British author and philosopher who is best known for writing A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). In that text, she argued that women are inherently equal to men, but appear inferior because they do not have the same access to education. Two years before, Wollstonecraft had responded to Edmund Burke’s conservative Reflections on the Revolution in France with her own A Vindication of the Rights of Men. Wollstonecraft’s daughter, Mary Shelley, is famous as the author of Frankenstein.\n\nLucretia Mott (1793–1880) Mott was a Quaker who agitated for both abolitionism and women’s rights. When she attended the World’s Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840, the male delegates excluded Mott and the other female delegates from the convention and made them sit in a segregated area. Mott then turned her attention to women’s rights. She was older than many of the other prominent delegates to the Seneca Falls Convention, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, whom she mentored. Mott briefly served as the first president of the American Equal Rights Association. She was also one of the Quakers who founded Swarthmore College.\n\nSojourner Truth (1797–1883) Sojourner Truth was born into slavery as Isabella Baumfree in Dutch-speaking New York. She gave herself the name “Sojourner Truth” in 1843 when she converted to Methodism and informed her friends that the spirit had called her. She was already well known as an abolitionist speaker when she attended the 1851 Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and declared that she had “as much muscle as any man” in her most famous speech, “Ain’t I a Woman?”.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806–1873) and Harriet Taylor Mill (1807–1858) John Stuart Mill was a utilitarian philosopher who comes up in quiz bowl most often in conjunction with his works On Liberty (1859) and Utilitarianism (1863). He makes this list, however, because he wrote one of the most influential philosophical defenses of women’s rights, The Subjection of Women (1869). Mill claimed that his wife, Harriet Taylor, co-authored this text with him, a claim which is debated by historians. The husband and wife did write several essays together, including a tract advocating women’s suffrage titled The Enfranchisement of Women (1851), and Mill recognized his wife as a major contributor to all his greatest works.\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton (1815–1902) Stanton is most famous for writing the “Declaration of Sentiments” that she presented at the first women’s rights conference in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. Stanton based the text of her declaration on the Declaration of Independence; it included the line, “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal.” Stanton was a close collaborator for many years with Susan B. Anthony.\n\nSusan B. Anthony (1820–1906) Anthony was one of the most outspoken and most famous proponents of women’s suffrage in the United States. Along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, she co-founded the first women’s temperance society in the 1850s after they were excluded from an all-male temperance society. Together, in 1868, the two women founded a journal called The Revolution, which was dedicated to promoting women’s rights. The following year, Stanton and Anthony formed the National Woman Suffrage Association. In 1872, Anthony gained fame when she was arrested for voting in the presidential election. She defended herself by quoting the Fourteenth Amendment, but she was convicted.\n\nEmmeline Pankhurst (1858–1928) Pankhurst was the most prominent advocate for women’s voting rights in the United Kingdom. As one of the founders of the Women’s Social and Political Union, she called for direct action and frequent protests to force male politicians to grant votes to women. Her protests frequently got her arrested, and while in jail she and other suffragettes often went on hunger strikes. Initially, prison officials brutally force-fed the hunger-striking suffragettes. In 1913, Parliament passed the Cat and Mouse Act, which provided for hunger strikers to be released from jail and re-arrested after they regained their health. As a result of the advocacy of Pankhurst and others, Parliament began to grant voting rights to women in 1918.\n\nMargaret Sanger (1879–1966) Sanger was an early advocate of birth control and reproductive rights; she founded the American Birth Control League, which evolved into Planned Parenthood. As a young nurse living in New York City, Sanger wrote columns about sexual education for the New York Call titled “What Every Mother Should Know” and “What Every Girl Should Know.” Sanger gave up nursing after one of her patients died of a self–induced abortion, and instead dedicated herself to educating women about contraception. In 1914, she began writing a newsletter called The Woman Rebel, in part to challenge the Comstock Act, which prohibited the sending of “obscene” material by mail, since she considered education about contraception to be an issue of free speech.\n\nVirginia Woolf (1882–1941) Woolf was an author who comes up in quiz bowl most often because of her novels, especially Mrs. Dalloway (1925) and To the Lighthouse (1927). She makes this list, however, because of her essay “A Room of One’s Own” (1929), in which she argued that a woman must have money and space in order to write and express herself. In the essay, Woolf famously created the character of Judith Shakespeare, William Shakespeare’s imagined sister, who could not achieve the status of her brother because she did not have the same access to education. Woolf also addressed these themes in Three Guineas (1938).\n\nSimone de Beauvoir (1908–1986) De Beauvoir was a French writer and philosopher perhaps best known for her feminist treatise The Second Sex (1949). In that work, de Beauvoir argued that “womanhood” is defined by its differences from masculinity, which is perceived as normal. The Second Sex contains the famous line, “One is not born a woman, but becomes one.” The book is divided into two parts, titled “Facts and Myths” and “Lived Experience.” One fact about de Beauvoir often mentioned in quiz bowl questions is that she was a lover of Jean-Paul Sartre. She is often considered one of the pioneers of “second-wave” feminism, which emphasizes sexuality, the workplace, and other forms of inequality over the first-wave focus on voting and property rights.\n\nBetty Friedan (1921–2006) Friedan was a writer and activist best known as the author of The Feminine Mystique (1963) and as the most prominent co-founder of the National Organization for Women. In 1957, Friedan conducted a survey of graduates of her alma mater, Smith College, and found that many of them were unhappy with their lives. Friedan labeled this general unhappiness “the problem with no name.” She then began writing The Feminine Mystique, in which she argued that being a housewife is unfulfilling and advocated for women to seek education and work outside the home.\n\nHelen Gurley Brown (1922–2012) Brown was best known as the editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan magazine from 1965 until 1997. Gurley Brown first came to prominence when she argued in Sex and the Single Girl (1962) that women ought to achieve financial security and pursue sexual relationships prior to marriage. As editor of Cosmopolitan, she asserted that women could “have it all,” by which she meant love, sex, and money.\n\nGloria Steinem (1934–present) Steinem is a journalist who founded and edited Ms. magazine. For an article in Show magazine in 1963, she went undercover as a Playboy bunny. Having had an abortion herself, she became a prominent advocate of abortion rights. She worked as a writer for New York magazine when she founded Ms., a feminist magazine devoted to women’s issues. The magazine also popularized the use of the title “Ms.” to address women regardless of marital status. Steinem also wrote the book Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions (1983), and the phrase “a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle” is often attributed to her.\n\nAlice Walker (1944–present) Walker is best known as the author of the novel The Color Purple (1982), but she is also renowned for her non-fiction writing about women’s issues. She joined the writing staff for Ms. magazine, for which she wrote “In Search of Zora Neale Hurston” (1975), stimulating interest in the then-forgotten Harlem Renaissance writer. Walker collected her critical essays on women’s fiction in In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens (1983). Among other arguments, she memorably contrasted Virginia Woolf and Phyllis Wheatley, noting that the latter had none of the advantages Woolf considered necessary in “A Room of One’s Own.” Along with Maxine Hong Kingston and other female authors, Walker was arrested in March 2003 for protesting the Iraq War on the grounds that it would unfairly punish Iraqi women and children.\n\nAmelia Bloomer advocated dress reform so that women could wear reasonable clothes; the pants known as “bloomers” were named after her.\n\nFrederick Douglass is best known as an abolitionist, but he attended the Seneca Falls Convention and was (without his consent) nominated as Victoria Woodhull’s vice-presidential candidate.\n\nMargaret Fuller was a journalist who advocated for women’s rights; she is best known for editing the transcendentalist journal The Dial.\n\nJulia Ward Howe was a reformer and women’s rights advocate who wrote the lyrics to “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.”\n\nAlice Paul picketed the White House and went on a hunger strike to agitate for the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. She later wrote the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923.\n\nWhen Gerrit Smith ran for president with the Liberal Party in 1848, he became the first presidential candidate to include women’s voting rights as part of his party’s platform. He was also a first cousin of Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\n\nLucy Stone is often grouped with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the “triumvirate” of American voting rights campaigners. She is famous for keeping her maiden name after marriage.\n\nIda B. Wells is best known as an opponent of lynching, but she was also a women’s rights crusader who agitated for the inclusion of black women in women’s groups such as the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union.\n\nVictoria Woodhull became the first female candidate for the presidency of the United States in 1872, when she ran with the Equal Rights Party.\n\nEmily Davison died when she ran in front of King George V’s horse at the Epsom Derby in 1913 with a “Votes for Women” banner.\n\nMillicent Fawcett led the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies, a more moderate organization than Emmeline Pankhurst’s Women’s Social and Political Union.\n\nMary Richardson attacked Diego Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus with a meat cleaver in 1914 to protest the arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst.\n\nBella Abzug advocated passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and was known for declaring that “a woman’s place is in the House — the House of Representatives.”\n\nIn 1972, Shirley Chisholm became the first black female candidate for a major party’s presidential nomination.\n\nMargaret Chase Smith was the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress and the first to be placed in nomination for the presidency of a major party.\n\nAndrea Dworkin wrote Pornography: Men Possessing Women (1979) to argue that pornography degrades women and leads to violence against women.\n\nGermaine Greer wrote The Female Eunuch (1970) to argue that traditional societal and family structures repress women.\n\nAnita Hill publicized the issue of sexual harassment in 1991 when she testified at Clarence Thomas’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings that he had harassed her.\n\nNaomi Wolf wrote The Beauty Myth (1991) to argue that societal constructs of beauty punish women who cannot attain them."

    "title": "Moons",
    "content": "Earth’s moon: The moon, also called Luna, is the fifth-largest satellite in the solar system, the largest relative to the size of the planet it orbits, and the second densest. The USSR’s Luna unmanned spacecraft first reached the moon in 1959, and Apollo 8 became the first manned mission to orbit the moon, in 1968. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty guarantees the rights of all nations to explore the moon for peaceful purposes. The flat dark lunar plains are called maria (singular: mare) and are mainly concentrated on the near side of the moon. The most famous one is Mare Tranquillitatis, the Sea of Tranquility, where Apollo 11 first landed on the moon in 1969. The Apollo program landed on the moon five more times.\n\nPhobos: Both Phobos (“fear”) and Mars’ smaller moon Deimos (“dread”) were discovered by Asaph Hall III in 1877. At just 3,700 miles above the Martian surface, Phobos orbits more closely to its planet than any other moon in the Solar System. Because it orbits Mars faster than Mars rotates, each day it appears (from the Martian surface) to set twice in the east. Geological features on Phobos, including the Stickney Crater, are primarily named for either astronomers (Stickney was the maiden name of Asaph Hall’s wife) or characters from Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels. In 1971 the U.S.’s Mariner IX became the first spacecraft to provide close-up photos of Phobos.\n\nDeimos: One-seventh the mass of Phobos and further away from the Martian surface, Deimos was found by Asaph Hall at the U.S. Naval Observatory six days before he discovered Phobos. Its largest and only named craters are Swift and Voltaire; Deimos’s surface doesn’t appear as rough as Phobos’s because regolith has filled in some of the craters. A still-controversial and unproven hypothesis holds that Deimos (and possibly Phobos as well) were asteroids perturbed out of their orbit by Jupiter and then captured by the gravity of Mars.\n\nIo is the innermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter (the moons discovered by Galileo), the fourth-largest moon in the solar system, the densest moon, and the most geologically active body in the solar system, with more than 400 volcanoes. Io’s features are named for characters from the Io story in Greek mythology; fire, volcano, and thunder deities from other mythologies; and characters from Dante’s Inferno. Io plays a significant role in shaping Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Pioneer 10 first passed by Io in December 1973.\n\nGanymede is the largest moon in the solar system and the only one known to have its own magnetosphere. The third of the Galilean satellites, Ganymede was also first photographed close-up by Pioneer 10 in 1973. Galileo made six flybys of Ganymede between 1996 and 2000. Based on a suggestion from Simon Marius, Ganymede (along with many of the Jovian satellites) is named for one of Jupiter’s lovers in Roman mythology; Ganymede is the only such moon named for a male figure. Many of Ganymede’s features, including the Enki Catena, are given names from Egyptian and Babylonian mythology, although its largest dark plain is Galileo Regio. Ganymede is scheduled to be orbited by the European Space Agency’s Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), currently slated for a 2022 launch.\n\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second largest in the solar system. Until Voyager 1 visited in 1980, it was thought to be larger than Ganymede. It is the only known satellite with a dense atmosphere — so dense that it makes observation of surface features nearly impossible except from close up — and also the only known satellite for which there is evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid. Discovered in 1655 by Christiaan Huygens, it was visited by the Cassini-Huygens mission in 2004. Titan’s albedo features, such as the highly reflective area Xanadu, are named for sacred or enchanted places from world literature and mythology. Because of its nitrogen-rich atmosphere and the presence of surface liquid, Titan is often thought to be the most likely place in the solar system for microbial life to exist outside of Earth.\n\nIapetus “eye”-AA-pih-tuss is Saturn’s third-largest moon after Titan and Rhea and, like Rhea, was discovered by Giovanni Cassini in 1671. It was named based upon a suggestion from John Herschel (son of the discoverer of Uranus, William Herschel) for the Titans of Greek mythology, the brothers and sisters of Cronos (Saturn). Iapetus has a distinctive two-tone coloration; part of it is red-brown, while part is bright gray. Features on Iapetus are named for people and places from the French Song of Roland, including Charlemagne Crater and the bright northern region Roncevaux Terra. In 2004 the Cassini orbiter found an equatorial ridge running over 800 miles long and 10 miles wide that gives Iapetus some of the highest peaks in the solar system; its existence has not yet been explained.\n\nTitania and Oberon: Uranus’s largest moons, Titania and Oberon, are named for characters from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. (Other Uranian moons are named for characters from either Shakespeare or Alexander Pope.) They were discovered on the same day in 1787 by William Herschel, who also discovered Uranus itself in 1781. In 1986 Voyager 2 became the only spacecraft to date to visit the Uranian moons. Because Uranus orbits the sun almost on its side and Titania and Oberon orbit Uranus in the same plane as its equator, the moons have extreme seasons: Titania’s poles spend over 42 years in nonstop sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness. Most of Titania’s features are named for settings or female characters from Shakespeare — its largest crater is Gertrude Crater, after Hamlet’s mother — while most of Oberon’s are named after settings or male characters from Shakespeare. However, Oberon’s largest feature is Mommur Chasma, which is named from a French epic poem.\n\nTriton: The largest moon of Neptune and the only large moon with a retrograde orbit (that is, an orbit opposite to the rotation of its planet), Triton is the seventh-largest moon in the solar system and is thought to have been captured from the Kuiper Belt. For over 100 years after its 1846 discovery, Triton was thought to be Neptune’s only moon; Nereid wasn’t discovered until 1949. (There are fourteen known satellites now.) Triton is geologically active and has geysers that are assumed to erupt nitrogen. Because of the activity, impact craters on Triton are relatively scarce; most of the larger craters were formed by volcanic activity. Triton orbits around Neptune in almost a perfect circle. Voyager 2 visited Triton in 1989 and is the only space probe to have done so (and no more are currently planned). Much of Triton’s western hemisphere consists of an unexplained series of fissures and depressions sometimes called “cantaloupe terrain.” Triton’s features are named after various water spirits, monsters, and sacred waters from mythology.\n\nCharon: The largest satellite of the dwarf planet Pluto, Charon wasn’t discovered until 1978. (As of 2013, Pluto has five known moons, the last two discovered in 2011 and 2012.) Unlike Pluto, which is covered with nitrogen and methane ices, Charon appears to be covered in water ice and may also have active cryo-geysers. Because the center of mass of the Pluto-Charon system lies outside of either one, Charon doesn’t truly orbit Pluto; when Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006, an argument was made (but not accepted) to classify Pluto-Charon as a binary system. The IAU still considers Charon, which is roughly half the size but has only 11% the mass of Pluto, to be a satellite. The New Horizons mission visited Charon and Pluto in 2015. Charon was named by its discoverer, James Christy of the Flagstaff Naval Observatory; the IAU approved the name in 1985. Internationally Charon is pronounced like the Greek mythological figure, “CARE-on”, but Christy’s choice of name was inspired by his wife Charlene, so NASA and New Horizons personnel use “SHARE-on”."

    "title": "Classic American Television Series",
    "content": "The Ed Sullivan Show (1948–1971): This long-running CBS variety show occupied the same time slot — Sunday night at 8 pm — for over two decades. For most of that time, it broadcast live from what is now called the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway, which is currently the home of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Among the characters it bequeathed to American popular culture were a Spanish ventriloquist known as “Señor Wences” and an Italian mouse puppet named Topo Gigio. In 1964, the Beatles appeared on the show for three straight weeks, appearances which are credited with launching the “British Invasion” in popular music.\n\nI Love Lucy (1951–1957): During its six-season run, I Love Lucy was one of America’s most watched shows. It centered on Lucy Ricardo, played by comedian Lucille Ball, and her husband Ricky Ricardo, who was played by Ball’s real-life husband Desi Arnaz. The show’s other major characters were the Ricardos’ neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz. In one of the show’s most famous episodes, Lucy was hired to do a TV commercial for a health tonic called “Vitameatavegamin”; after drinking too much of it, Lucy becomes inebriated and is unable to pronounce the word correctly.\n\nThe Honeymooners (1955–1956): The Honeymooners is considered the first TV spinoff, as it centered on a character — Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden — who had previously been introduced on The Jackie Gleason Show. Ralph’s wife Alice was frequently the recipient of his bombastic threats, such as “Bang zoom, straight to the moon!”. Like I Love Lucy, the show also centrally featured a neighbor couple — in this case, Ed and Trixie Norton. Although The Honeymooners is now considered a classic sitcom, it was not very popular at the time, and only 39 episodes aired in its original one-season run.\n\nGunsmoke (1955–1975): With 635 episodes that aired over 20 seasons, Gunsmoke was the longest-running prime-time series in American television history until The Simpsons overtook it. Set in Dodge City, Kansas in the late 19th century, it centered on U.S. marshal Matt Dillon. For several seasons in the early 1960s, it featured a young Burt Reynolds as the blacksmith Quint Asper.\n\nMr. Ed (1958–1966): This classic sitcom centered on the title talking horse — a palomino whose voice was provided by Allan Lane — and his owner, the architect Wilbur Post. Much of the show’s humor derived from the fact that Mr. Ed would solely speak to Wilbur, which naturally led to hijinks. Mr. Ed should not be confused with Francis the Talking Mule, who would solely speak to his owner Peter Stirling; he appeared in a number of film comedies during the 1950s.\n\nThe Twilight Zone (1959–1964): Rod Serling created this anthology series, whose iconic opening credits featured a theme composed by Bernard Herrmann and a narration warning that the viewer was “about to enter another dimension.” One of its most famous episodes, “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,” starred a young William Shatner as a salesman who becomes convinced that a gremlin nobody else can see is trying to crash the airplane on which he is flying.\n\nThe Andy Griffith Show (1960–1968): One of the most popular TV series of its decade, The Andy Griffith Show starred its title actor as Andy Taylor, the sheriff in the sleepy small town of Mayberry, North Carolina. The show is almost as well known for its distinctive supporting characters, including a gas station attendant named Gomer Pyle and Andy’s awkward deputy sheriff, Barney Fife. Ron Howard rose to fame as a child actor on the show, playing Andy’s son Opie, before going on to an adult career as a prolific actor and director.\n\nThe Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–1977): This sitcom centered on Mary Richards, a young woman who moves to Minneapolis, where she goes to work in the newsroom at WJM-TV. No fewer than three supporting characters eventually got their own spinoffs: Phyllis, which starred Cloris Leachman; Rhoda, which starred Valerie Harper; and Lou Grant, which — unlike both the other two spinoffs and The Mary Tyler Moore Show itself — was a drama rather than a sitcom. The show is considered groundbreaking for its portrayal of Mary as an independent single woman.\n\nAll in the Family (1971–1979): Producer Norman Lear created this sitcom, which was based on the successful British series Till Death Us Do Part. It starred Carroll O’Connor and Jean Stapleton as the central couple, Archie and Edith Bunker; Archie was notable for his prejudicial attitudes, while Edith — whom Archie would refer to as his “dingbat” — was his long-suffering wife. The show also featured Sherman Hemsley as George Jefferson, who would later be given his own spinoff, The Jeffersons, in which he and his wife “moved on up to a deluxe apartment in the sky” on the East Side of Manhattan.\n\nM*A*S*H (1972–1983): Like The Mary Tyler Moore Show and All in the Family, M*A*S*H was a highly successful CBS sitcom that dealt with controversial social issues — in this case, war. Centering on the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in South Korea, it was adapted from the 1970 feature film of the same name directed by Robert Altman. Major characters included Hawkeye Pierce, a wisecracking surgeon played by Alan Alda; Sherman Potter, who was added to the show in season 4 after the previous commanding officer, Henry Blake, was killed off; and Corporal Klinger, who would dress in women’s clothing in an attempt to be discharged from the army."

    "title": "Peoples Of The Early Middle Ages",
    "content": "In the late fourth century, the Huns entered central Europe from the steppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas. Historians disagree on what, if any, components of the Hunnic advance should be identified with the Xiongnu, a confederation of Central Asian nomads that fought against Han China before being dispersed in the third century. The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus wrote that they inflicted “tremendous slaughter” on Germanic and Roman enemies alike. Their great leader, Attila — known as the “scourge of God” — was defeated at the Catalaunian Fields (near Chalons in what is now northern France) by an alliance of Romans and Visigoths. After Attila’s death in 453, a rebellion of Germanic subject peoples broke up the Hunnic empire.\n\nThe Visigoths were one of a number of Germanic peoples scattered by the advance of the Huns. They took refuge south of the Danube under the protection of the Roman Empire. When that “protection” was revealed to consist of abuse, fraud, and starvation, they rebelled and caused disorder in Rome’s Balkan provinces. When the emperor Valens sent in the army to restore order, Goths — led by Fritigern — shattered the Roman army at Adrianople (378), where Valens was killed. For the next forty years, groups of Visigoths wandered the Roman world searching for a place to settle. In 410 Visigoths led by Alaric sacked Rome itself. By the middle of the fifth century, the Visigoths had settled in southern Gaul (the “kingdom of Toulouse”) and the Iberian peninsula. Christians among the Visigoths, like those among their Ostrogothic and Vandalic neighbors, subscribed to the heretical “Arian” beliefs, which caused conflict with their Roman subjects until the Visigothic kings converted at a 589 church council. Driven out of southern Gaul by the hostile Franks, the Visigoths retained control over most of what is now Spain until their king Roderic was killed by Islamic invaders from North Africa in 711.\n\nWhen the Visigoths fled into the Roman empire, the Ostrogoths were one of numerous Germanic peoples subjected to the Huns north of the Danube. They threw off Hunnic domination after the death of Attila. After the last Roman emperor of the west, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed in 476, the Ostrogoths took advantage of the chaos to occupy Italy and establish their own kingdom. Their king Theodoric, known as “the Great,” ruled from 493 to 526 and tried to restore peace to Italy. The philosopher Boethius worked as an official at Theodoric’s court. The Ostrogothic kingdom collapsed in the 6th century after the Byzantine generals Belisarius and Narses fought a series of destructive wars for control of the Italian peninsula.\n\nThe Vandals were one of several peoples who crossed the frozen Rhine River into Roman Gaul on New Years’ Eve, 406. From Gaul they moved into Spain and across the Strait of Gibraltar to attack Roman Africa. By 439 the Vandals had occupied Carthage, gaining control of the grain trade and possession of a substantial navy. This they used to embark on a second career as Mediterranean pirates; their sack of Rome in 455 under King Gaiseric was reputedly much more destructive than the Visigothic one 45 years earlier. The ravages of the Vandals so dismayed Roman observers that “vandalism” still indicates senselessly destructive behavior. Like the Ostrogoths, the Vandals were targets of the Byzantine emperor Justinian’s attempted reconquest of the western Mediterranean; Justinian’s general Belisarius smashed the Vandal army at Tricamerum in December 533.\n\nThe Lombards moved into northern Italy (the region still known today as “Lombardy”) after the peninsula had been devastated by the war between the Byzantines and the Ostrogoths. Lombard dukes and kings shared control of Italy with the remaining Byzantine garrisons. Although the Lombards were Catholics, their relationship with the papacy was often turbulent. Papal requests for assistance led to the 8th-century invasion by Frankish forces under Charlemagne, who crushed the Lombard kingdom and seized the Lombards’ “iron crown.” The Lombard historian Paul the Deacon retired to the abbey of Monte Cassino to write a chronicle of his now-vanquished people.\n\nThe Franks settled in Gaul late in the 5th century, displacing the Roman official Syagrius. Clovis, the first great ruler of their Merovingian dynasty, converted to (Catholic) Christianity in 496. The close association between the Franks and the papacy benefited both parties in an age when their mutual enemies (such as the Visigoths) were either heretics or still pagan. Merovingian Gaul was wracked by civil war among contending Frankish kings; by the beginning of the 8th century the Merovingians had lost effective power to their chief ministers, the “mayors of the palace.” In 751 mayor Pepin the Short, with permission from the pope, deposed the last Merovingian and established a new Carolingian dynasty of Frankish kings. Pepin’s son was Charlemagne, who subjugated much of western Europe and presided over a revival of learning known as the “Carolingian Renaissance.” On Christmas Day 800 Charlemagne was crowned emperor in Rome. Charlemagne’s grandsons quarreled over rights to his inheritance, splitting the Frankish empire into a cluster of regional domains. The westernmost (“West Francia”) became the kingdom of France; the eastern one beyond the Rhine (“East Francia”) retained the imperial title as the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Picts, the early medieval inhabitants of northern Britain, were known for their raids on the Roman frontier fortification Hadrian’s Wall. Their name (from the Latin pictus, “painted”) may refer to their use of colorful tattoos. Pictish art is notable for elaborate stone carvings of mysterious beasts. Starting in the 9th century, the Pictish kingdoms were absorbed by the neighboring kingdom of the Scots.\n\n“Anglo-Saxons” is the conventional designation for a group of Germanic peoples (primarily Angles, Saxons, and Jutes) who migrated from northwestern Europe (the North Sea coast of Germany and mainland Denmark) to Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries. The Anglo-Saxon settlers conquered or displaced the Roman and British inhabitants of the island (the semilegendary King Arthur is portrayed as a British ruler fighting against Saxon expansion). By the early 7th century, seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms across southern and eastern Britain were known collectively as the Heptarchy (a group of seven rulers). Christian missionaries arrived from Italy and Ireland to convert the pagan Anglo-Saxons. Cultural products of the newly Christian kingdoms included illuminated manuscripts; the writings of the monastic historian the Venerable Bede, and the epic poem Beowulf. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were hard-hit by the Viking raids of the 9th century; only Wessex, the southwesternmost kingdom, survived and repelled the Scandinavian raiders. The kings of Wessex then unified the Anglo-Saxon territories as a single kingdom of England.\n\nThe Magyars, like the Huns, were a nomadic people of central Asia. Their language is Ugric, related to Finnish and a number of west Siberian languages. Magyars occupied the Danube basin shortly before 900. They exploited the decline of the Carolingian empire to carry out raids on East Francia and Italy. The 955 Battle of Lechfeld, won by Germany’s Otto the Great, halted their expansion into central Europe. At the end of the 10th century, the Magyar grand prince was baptized with the name Stephen and crowned the first king of Hungary.\n\nVikings (alternatively: Norsemen or Northmen) were seaborne raiders from Scandinavia who used longships to attack coastal regions of western Europe between the late 8th and 11th centuries. Although they are best known for pillaging English and Irish monasteries, Vikings also settled and traded on waterways all over northern and eastern Europe, founding cities in Russia and making voyages to Iceland, Greenland, and the New World. Vikings who seized part of northern France from Charlemagne’s heirs established the duchy of Normandy. During the 11th century, Normans fought as mercenaries and built castles in Sicily, southern Italy, France, and Britain. Norman Duke William earned the epithet “the Conqueror” for his victory over the Anglo-Saxons at the 1066 Battle of Hastings."

    "title": "Anthropologists",
    "content": "Franz Boas (1858–1942) Often called the founder of modern anthropology, this first professor of anthropology at Columbia University trained Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, Alfred Kroeber, author Zora Neale Hurston, and many others. He conducted fieldwork on the Inuits of Baffin Island and the Kwakiutl (now referred to as Kwakwaka’wakw) on Vancouver Island. His publications include 1911’s The Mind of Primitive Man, which describes a gift-giving ceremony known as the “potlatch.”\n\nMargaret Mead (1901–1978) For her best-known work, Coming of Age in Samoa, Mead interviewed young girls on the island Ta’u, which led her to conclude that adolescence in Samoan society was much less stressful than in the United States; in The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead, Derek Freeman claimed that she was lied to in those interviews. She also studied three tribes in New Guinea — the Arapesh, Mundugumor, and Tchambuli — for her book on Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies.\n\nRuth Benedict (1887–1948) A colleague and friend of Margaret Mead, Benedict studied the Zuni, Dobu, and Kwakiutl cultures in Patterns of Culture, using them to illustrate the idea of a society’s culture as “personality writ large.” She also described Japanese culture in The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, a work written during World War II at the request of the U.S. government.\n\nBronisław Malinowski BROH-nee-swaf mah-lee-NAWF-skee (1884–1942) The Polish-born Malinowski studied at the London School of Economics, where he would later spend most of his career. He described the “kula ring” gift exchanges found in the Trobriand Islands in Argonauts of the Western Pacific, and the use of magic in agriculture in Coral Gardens and Their Magic. He also argued, in opposition to Sigmund Freud, that the Oedipus complex was not a universal element of human culture in his book on Sex and Repression in Savage Society.\n\nClaude Lévi-Strauss (1908–2009) In the 1930s, Lévi-Strauss did fieldwork with the Nambikwara people of Brazil, which formed the basis for his thesis on “The Elementary Structures of Kinship.” He held the chair in social anthropology at the Collège de France from 1959 to 1982, during which time he published such books as The Savage Mind and a tetralogy about world mythology whose volumes include The Raw and the Cooked. He pioneered in applying the structuralist methods of Ferdinand de Saussure to anthropology, which led him to study cultures as sets of binary oppositions.\n\nClifford Geertz (1926–2006) Geertz is best known for his work in symbolic anthropology, a view that he expounded in his book The Interpretation of Cultures. In that book, he introduced the term “thick description” to describe his method of analyzing behavior within its social context. One such “thick description” appears in his essay “Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight,” in which Geertz discusses cockfighting as a symbolic display of a certain kind of masculinity.\n\nAlfred Radcliffe-Brown (1881–1955) Radcliffe-Brown is considered the founder of a school of anthropology known as structural functionalism, which focuses on identifying the groups within a society and the rules and customs that define the relationships between people. His own early fieldwork was conducted in the Andaman Islands and Western Australia, where he studied the social organization of Australian tribes. After teaching in Australia, South Africa, and at the University of Chicago, he returned to England, where he founded the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology at Oxford.\n\nJames Frazer (1854–1941) Frazer was a Scottish anthropologist who primarily studied mythology and comparative religion. His magnum opus, The Golden Bough, analyzed a wide range of myths that center on the death and rebirth of a solar deity; the original publication controversially discussed the crucifixion of Jesus as one such myth. The work’s title refers to a gift given to Proserpine (Persephone) by Aeneas so that he could enter the underworld in the Aeneid.\n\nThor Heyerdahl (1914–2002) In 1947, Heyerdahl and five companions sailed across the Pacific Ocean — going from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands — on a balsa-wood raft named Kon-Tiki, after the Incan sun god Kon-Tiki Viracocha. He later built two boats from papyrus (Ra, which failed in 1969, and Ra II, which succeeded in 1970) to sail across the Atlantic Ocean. These voyages demonstrated the possibility that ancient people could have migrated around the globe using only primitive rafts.\n\nJane Goodall (born 1934) Goodall is a British primatologist who is best known for her work with chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania. Her first research was carried out with Louis Leakey at Olduvai Gorge. In her pioneering work with primates, which is detailed in such books as In the Shadow of Man, she discovered that chimpanzees have the ability to use tools, such as inserting grass into termite holes to “fish” for termites."

    "title": "20th-century Physicists",
    "content": "Niels Bohr (1885–1962) Bohr reconciled Rutherford’s results from the gold foil experiment with Max Planck’s quantum theory to create a model of the atom (the Bohr model) in which electrons resided in specific energy levels at specific stable radii. This model was the basis for Johann Balmer’s work with spectroscopy and Johannes Rydberg’s energy formula, which explicitly stated the frequency of light that an electron would emit if it went from a higher energy to a lower energy. Bohr and his son fled to the U.S. in World War II under the pseudonym “Baker,” and contributed to the Manhattan Project.\n\nLouis de Broglie duh-BROH-lee (1892–1987) De Broglie’s work quantifying the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics earned him the 1929 Nobel Prize in Physics. His doctoral thesis, which proposed that all particles have a characteristic wavelength dependent on their momentum, was so groundbreaking that the reviewers passed it directly to Albert Einstein, who endorsed it. In opposition to the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, de Broglie later worked to define a purely causal interpretation, but his work remained unfinished until David Bohm refined it in the 1950s.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879–1955) In one year — 1905, called his annus mirabilis, or “miracle year” — Albert Einstein authored four papers that revolutionized modern physics. The first explained the photoelectric effect in terms of quantized electromagnetic radiation. The second formed the foundation for modern statistical physics by explaining the seemingly-random motion of particles in a fluid, a behavior called Brownian motion. The third reconciled Maxwellian electrodynamics with classical mechanics by positing a finite, constant speed of light, a theory now known as special relativity. The fourth paper contained his statement that the energy of a body is equal to its mass times the speed of light squared (that is, E = mc2). Ten years later, in 1915, Einstein published his theory of general relativity, which generalized special relativity to account for gravitational fields.\n\nEnrico Fermi (1901–1954) Fermi is best known to the public as a main contributor to the Manhattan Project. His work with statistical physics laid the groundwork for modern electronics and solid-state technologies. He applied the Pauli exclusion principle to subatomic particles to create Fermi-Dirac statistics, which accurately predicted the low-temperature behavior of electrons. Particles that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics are called fermions in his honor. Fermi also suggested the existence of the neutrino in order to balance nuclear beta-decay chains.\n\nRichard Feynman (1918–1988). Feynman developed a mathematical formalism called the path integral formulation of quantum theory that utilized the “sum over histories,” taking into account all possible paths a particle could take. This constituted the creation of quantum electrodynamics and earned him the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics. He also used the sum over histories in developing Feynman diagrams, which illustrate the interaction of subatomic particles. Aside from being a prolific physicist, Feynman was also an accomplished bongo player and sketch artist.\n\nGeorge Gamow (1904–1968) Gamow was one of the first to explain the implications of the Big Bang theory of cosmology. He correctly predicted the abundance of hydrogen and helium in the early universe, nicknamed Alpher-Bethe-Gamow theory (an intentional pun on the first three letters of the Greek alphabet, alpha, beta, and gamma, for which the otherwise unrelated physicist Hans Bethe was included), and also theorized that the the heat from the Big Bang would still be visible as the cosmic microwave background radiation. Although Gamow received no Nobel for this prediction, the CMB’s discoverers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, as well as two later observers, John Mather and George Smoot, did receive Nobels.\n\nWerner Heisenberg (1901–1976) Heisenberg is most known for his matrix interpretation of quantum theory, which constructs observable quantities as operators that act on a system. His famous uncertainty principle (better translated, however, as “indeterminacy principle”) states that the more accurately an object’s position can be observed, the less accurately its momentum can. This is because shorter wavelengths of light (used as a sort of measuring-stick) have higher energies, and disrupt a particle’s momentum more strongly. Heisenberg earned the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the allotropic forms of hydrogen.\n\nMax Planck (1858–1947) Planck allowed quantum theory to move forward in the early 20th century by correctly modeling how an object radiates heat, solving the ultraviolet catastrophe, which was a predicted unbounded increase in the amount of radiation emitted at high frequencies. Planck’s Law of Radiation superseded the Rayleigh-Jeans Law. He suggested that electromagnetic energy could only be emitted in specific packages, called quanta (singular quantum, from the Latin for “how much”), positing that the energy of this photon was equal to its frequency times a fixed value h, now known as Planck’s constant.\n\nErnest Rutherford (1871–1937) Rutherford’s gold foil experiment provided the first evidence that each atom is made up of a large, positively-charged nucleus, surrounded by a cloud of negatively-charged electrons. Rutherford won the 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. Rutherford was also an early leader in nuclear fission techniques, having discovered the decay of carbon-14 and providing the impetus for modern carbon dating. As part of this research, he discovered the proton and neutron, the latter in cooperation with James Chadwick. He is also the only native New Zealander with an element named after him (Rutherfordium, atomic number 104).\n\nErwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) Schrödinger contributed to the early formulations of quantum theory as a foil to Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, and Paul Dirac, criticizing their Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics with thought experiments like his famous Schrödinger’s Cat argument. He formulated both the time-independent and time-dependent Schrödinger equations, which are partial differential equations that describe how quantum systems behave. Schrödinger’s work was the basis for Heisenberg’s matrix formalism, Feynman’s path-integral formalism, and quantum mechanical perturbation theory, which considers the effects of a small disturbance to a quantum system.\n\nMarie (1867–1945) and Pierre (1859–1906) Curie rigorously isolated and experimented on radioactive materials, forming the basis for early nuclear and particle physics.\n\nPaul Dirac (1902–1984) was one of the first to attempt a generalization of quantum theory to relativistic speeds, the result of which was the Dirac equation.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann (1929–2019) predicted the existence of quarks, which compose protons, neutrons, and other, heavier particles.\n\nRobert Millikan (1868–1953; not to be confused with Robert Mullikan, a chemist) determined the charge of the electron by meticulously observing oil droplets in an electric field and noting the time it took them to fall a certain distance.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967) oversaw much of the Manhattan Project, but was later stripped of his security clearance during the McCarthy-era Red Scare, as a result of his acquaintance with communists and his enmity with Edward Teller.\n\nWolfgang Pauli’s (1900–1958) namesake exclusion principle prohibits most types of particles from occupying the same state, and forms the basis for chemical bonds."

    "title": "Western European Rivers",
    "content": "Rhine: The Rhine begins in the Swiss Alps, passes through Lake Constance (in German, the Bodensee), flows west along the German-Swiss border, then turns north to form part of the German-French border. The river then flows north and joins with the Meuse and Scheldt to enter the North Sea at a delta in the Netherlands. Cities along its course include Basel, Strasbourg, Mainz, Bonn, Cologne, and Rotterdam, and tributaries include the Main, Mosel, and Ruhr. The Rhine has played a strategic role in most German conflicts since the time of the Gallic Wars, but was not established as an international waterway until the Rhine Commission of 1815. German myth tells of the Lorelei, a nymph who lured sailors on the Rhine to their deaths.\n\nSeine: Though only the second-longest river in France (behind the Loire), the Seine is of key importance, as it flows through Paris. Starting on the Plateau de Langres near Dijon, the Seine weaves northwest for 485 miles to enter the English Channel near Le Havre. Along the way, it passes through Troyes, Fontainebleau, and Rouen. The Seine is France’s chief transport waterway, along with its tributaries the Marne and Oise.\n\nTagus (or Tajo or Tejo): The Tagus is the principal river of the Iberian Peninsula. Rising in east-central Spain, it flows west for roughly 645 miles to the Atlantic, passing through Lisbon, Portugal on the way. The cities of Toledo and Santarém are on the Tagus, and hydroelectric dams on the river produce huge artificial lakes, including the Sea of Castile.\n\nRhone: One of Europe’s few major rivers to flow directly into the Mediterranean (via the Gulf of Lion), the Rhone originates in the Swiss Alps and flows into Lake Geneva. It emerges from Geneva and flows south, passes through Lyon, Avignon, and Arles, and enters the sea just west of Marseille. At Arles, the river splits into “grand” and “petit” branches that encircle the island Camargue. The river’s valley is famous for its red wine, and because it is navigable for 300 miles, the Rhone is the key access route of southern France.\n\nDanube: Most of the Danube is in Eastern Europe, but it begins in Germany’s Black Forest (Schwarzwald) near Freiburg, crossing Bavaria before it enters Austria. In all, it passes through (or touches the borders of) 10 nations on its 1,785-mile course ending at the Black Sea. Chief tributaries include the Drava and Sava, and it passes through four national capitals: Vienna, Bratislava, Budapest, and Belgrade. Formerly known as the Ister, the Danube was often used to define a northern border for the Roman Empire.\n\nPo: Italy’s longest river at 405 miles, it passes through Piedmont and Lombardy before entering the Adriatic 30 miles south of Venice. It flows through Turin and Cremona, and it passes near Milan, Padua, Pavia, and Mantua. The river has a long history of floods, and the manmade levees called argini which protect towns and crops can exacerbate the floods. Pollution, especially from Milan, is becoming a major environmental concern.\n\nLoire: France’s longest river, the Loire begins in the Cevennes range of southern France, flows north to the center of the country, then flows due west to the Bay of Biscay. Many notable cities are on the river, including Nevers, Orleans, Blois, Tours, and Nantes. The Loire is sometimes called the “last wild river in Western Europe,” and many proposed dams on the river have not been built because of opposition to the flooding of land and to interference with Atlantic salmon. The Loire Valley is particularly known for its vineyards and for its châteaux, a collection of over 300 castles dating to the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nShannon: At 230 miles, the Shannon is Ireland’s longest river. It flows from Lough Allen, and Loughs Ree and Derg are also on its course. At Limerick, the river widens into its namesake estuary and runs for 50 more miles before it enters the Atlantic. Peat bogs and marshes line the river for much of its course, and the Shannon is considered a dividing line between Ireland’s more cultivated east and wild west. A chief tributary is the Suck River. The Shannon does not pass through Dublin, although the Liffey does.\n\nOder: Along with the Neisse, the Oder forms the Germany-Poland border, as dictated at the Potsdam Conference in July and August of 1945. One of the largest rivers to enter the Baltic, it has been a major transport route for centuries. Ostrava in the Czech Republic and Breslau in Poland are on the river. Near its mouth is Stettin, which Churchill used as the northern terminus of his “Iron Curtain” (Trieste, in the South, is an Adriatic port not near a major river). At the mouth of the Oder are Usedom Island, Swinemuende, and Peenemuende, which were primary test sites for the German V-2 rocket in the 1940s.\n\nElbe (or Labe): Rising in the Krkonose Mountains of the Sudetenland in the Czech Republic, the river flows near Prague, then enters eastern Germany and flows northwest to the North Sea. It receives the Vltava (or Moldau), the Saale, and the Havel/Spree, and the many large cities on its course include Dresden, Dessau, Magdeburg, Wittenberg, and Hamburg. Like the Oder, the Elbe has been a key transportation route for many centuries.\n\nThames: Running from Thames Head near Cirencester to an estuary near Southend in Essex, the Thames is the principal river of England and flows through central London. The Houses of Parliament and the London Eye overlook the Thames, as does Big Ben. Flowing through Reading, Oxford, and Swindon, the Thames is prevented from flooding London by its namesake Barrier near the Isle of Dogs. Though it is the longest river entirely in England, the Thames trails the Severn (which also flows into Wales) as the longest river in the United Kingdom."

    "title": "Battles Of The Ancient World",
    "content": "One of the earliest battles in recorded history, the Battle of Kadesh (1274 BC) was fought near the Orontes River in what is now Syria between Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II and the Hittite king Muwatalli II. Although Ramses proclaimed a great victory for himself, he was lucky to achieve a stalemate after being ambushed by Hittite chariots. Kadesh was probably the largest chariot battle in history, with over 5,000 chariots engaged. The Egyptian chariots were smaller and faster than those used by the Hittites, which gave the Egyptians an advantage.\n\nPersian King Darius I’s invasion of mainland Greece ended with a decisive victory for Miltiades and the Athenians at Marathon (490 BC). The defeated Persian commanders were Datis and Artaphernes. Among the few Athenian dead of the battle were archon Callimachus and the general Stesilaos. Legend has it that the Greek messenger Pheidippides ran to Athens with news of the victory, but collapsed upon arrival. This is the inspiration for the modern race known as the “marathon.”\n\nThermopylae (480 BC) was the first battle of the second Persian invasion of Greece. Although the Persians under Xerxes I and his general Mardonius defeated the Spartans, King Leonidas and his Spartan troops put up a heroic defense of the pass at Thermopylae (the “hot gates”). The Greeks were betrayed by Ephialtes, who told the Persians about a path that led behind the Spartans. The battle was part of Themistocles’ plan to halt the advance of the Persians. The other part of his plan was to block the Persian navy at Artemisium; a battle occurred there simultaneously.\n\nThe naval battle at Salamis (480 BC) was a major turning point in the Greco-Persian Wars, as it signaled the beginning of the end of Persian attempts to conquer Greece. The battle is named after an island in the Saronic Gulf near Athens. Xerxes was so confident in victory that he watched the battle from a throne on the slopes of Mount Aegaleus. The Athenian general Themistocles devised a plan to lure the large, slow Persian ships into the narrow straits, where the Greek ships were able to outmaneuver and destroy much of the Persian fleet. The Persian admiral Ariabignes was killed in hand-to-hand combat, and the Queen of Halicarnassus, Artemisia, had to sink some of her allies’ ships to escape.\n\nThe Battle of Aegospotami (405 BC) on the Hellespont (Dardanelles) ended the Peloponnesian War and the Athenian Empire. After a setback at the Battle of Arginusae in 406 BC, the Spartans reinstated Lysander as the commander of their fleet. The result was a complete victory for Sparta; only a fraction of the Athenian fleet survived, including the general Conon, and the ship Paralus, which brought the news of defeat to Athens. Following the battle, the Spartans besieged Athens and forced its surrender.\n\nAfter the Battle of Granicus, Issus (333 BC) was the second major battle between Alexander the Great and the Persian Empire, and the first to feature Darius III. The battle was fought along the Pinarus River near what is now Iskenderun in Turkey’s Hatay province. Before the battle, Darius was able to surprise Alexander and cut him off from the main force of Macedonians. However, the battle ended with Darius fleeing the field and the capture of his tent and family. The battle was the subject of a 1528 painting by Albrecht Altdorfer, the leader of the Danube School.\n\nThe largest battle of the Second Punic War, Cannae (216 BC) represented one of the worst defeats in Roman history. The Carthaginians were led by Hannibal, while the Romans were led by the consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro. Hannibal employed a double-envelopment tactic, surrounded the Roman army, and destroyed it. Although a total disaster for the Romans, it resulted in the revival of the Fabian strategy, in which battles are avoided in favor of a war of attrition. This eventually wore down Hannibal’s army, and the Carthaginians had to leave Italy.\n\nThe final battle of the Second Punic War, Zama (202 BC) was fought near Carthage in what is now Tunisia. Scipio Africanus’s victory at the Battle of the Great Plains in 203 BC forced Hannibal to leave Italy and return to North Africa for the final showdown. Prior to the battle, the Numidian king Masinissa switched sides, and brought his considerable cavalry force to join the Romans. This, coupled with Scipio’s strategy of opening up his lines to allow Carthaginian elephants through without harming his troops, led to a complete Roman victory.\n\nAt Alesia (52 BC), Julius Caesar defeated the Celtic peoples of Gaul, establishing Roman rule of the lands beyond the Alps. The battle began when Caesar besieged Vercingetorix in the town of Alesia, shortly after the Roman defeat at Gergovia. The Romans built a wall to surround the city (a “circumvallation”) and a second wall around that (a “contravallation”) to protect themselves from the Gaulish relief army under Commius. When Commius launched a massive attack on the Romans, Caesar was able to defeat him and force the surrender of Vercingetorix. Although the Romans were outnumbered by as much as four to one, they proved victorious in what was the turning point of the Gallic Wars.\n\nAt Actium (31 BC), the fleet of Octavian defeated the combined forces of Cleopatra and Mark Antony at this battle near what is now Preveza in the Ambracian Gulf of Greece. Marcus Agrippa commanded Octavian’s fleet, which consisted of small, nimble Liburnian ships. Antony’s fleet consisted of massive Quinqueremes, which were less mobile. Following his victory in the battle, Octavian titled himself Princeps, and later Augustus. To some, Actium signals the end of the Roman Republic.\n\nThe Battle of the Milvian Bridge (AD 312) was part of the civil war that ensued when Maxentius usurped the throne of the western half of the Roman Empire from Constantine. Prior to the battle, Constantine supposedly had a vision of God promising victory to his forces if he painted his shields with the Chi-Rho, a Christian symbol. Constantine was indeed victorious, and Maxentius drowned in the Tiber River during the battle. Eventually, Constantine was able to abolish the Tetrarchy, become the sole ruler of the Roman Empire, and end persecution of Christians.\n\nTaking place near what is now Edirne, Turkey, the Battle of Adrianople (AD 378) signalled the beginning of the spread of Germanic peoples into the Western Roman Empire. The Romans were led by the eastern emperor Valens, while the Goths were led by Fritigern. Eager for glory, Valens decided not to wait on reinforcements from the western emperor Gratian, and instead attacked the Goths. In the battle, over two-thirds of the Roman army was killed, including Valens. The battle was chronicled by Ammianus Marcellinus, who thought it so important that he ended his history of the Roman Empire with the battle.\n\nThe Battle of Chalons (or Catalaunian Fields) (AD 451) was an epic battle between the Romans and the Huns fought in what is now France. The Roman army was commanded by Flavius Aetius and included Visigoths under Theodoric I, who was killed by an Ostrogoth during the battle. The Hunnic army was led by Attila, who was rampaging through Gaul. The battle ended with a victory for the Roman-Visigothic alliance, which stopped the Huns’ advance into Gaul. The next year, Attila invaded Italy; however, in 453, Attila died and his empire broke up shortly after."

    "content": "Romanov (Russia, 1613–1917): Following the Time of Troubles, the sixteen-year-old Michael Romanov was appointed tsar and co-ruled with his father, Patriarch Filaret. Its rulers included Peter the Great (who westernized Russia and defeated Sweden in the Great Northern War), Catherine the Great (an “enlightened despot” who greatly expanded the borders of Russia), and Alexander II (who freed the serfs). The Romanovs ruled Russia as tsars and emperors until the Russian Revolution and Nicholas II’s execution.\n\nOrange-Nassau (Netherlands, 1544–present): The House of Orange was founded by William the Silent, who led the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish in the Eighty Years’ War, resulting in the recognition of the Netherlands’ independence in 1648. In 1688, William III of Orange, at the invitation of Parliament, invaded England with his wife Mary in what is called the Glorious Revolution. The House of Orange is currently led by Willem-Alexander, the King of the Netherlands.\n\nHohenzollern (Brandenburg 1415–1618, Prussia 1525–1918, Germany 1871–1918, and Romania 1866–1947): The House of Hohenzollern began as Burgraves of Nuremburg, but eventually gained such titles as Margrave of Brandenburg, Duke and later King of Prussia, Emperor of Germany, and King of Romania. Some of its notable rulers included Frederick the Great (an enlightened ruler who led Prussian troops during the Seven Years’ War) and Wilhelm II (the Emperor of Germany during World War I).\n\nHapsburg, also known as Habsburg (Holy Roman Empire 1440–1806, Austria-Hungary 1867–1918, and Spain 1516–1700): The Hapsburgs ruled much of Central Europe from the Middle Ages to the end of World War I. Their first important ruler was Rudolf I, the King of Germany and Duke of Austria in the late thirteenth century. Other notable rulers included Charles V, Maria Theresa and Franz Joseph.\n\nPlantagenet (England, 1154–1399): The Plantagenets rose to power when Geoffrey V of Anjou married Matilda, and their rule ended when Richard II was deposed in 1399. Some of their notable rulers included Richard I, John, and Edward I. The signing of the Magna Carta, the English conquest of Wales, and the beginning of the Hundred Years’ War all occurred during their reign. The houses of Lancaster and York were cadet branches (new royal houses formed by non-inheriting members) of the Plantagenets.\n\nTudor (England, 1485–1603): The Tudors rose to power when Henry Tudor aligned with the Lancasters in the War of the Roses. He became King Henry VII following his victory at Bosworth Field. Their notable rulers included Henry VIII (who broke with the Catholic Church in England and had six wives) and Elizabeth I (whose lack of a husband and heir led to the extinction of the house).\n\nStuart (England, 1603–1714 and Scotland, 1371–1714): The first Stuart king of England was James I (James VI of Scotland), who commissioned the King James Bible and survived the Gunpowder Plot. Other notable rulers included Charles I (who was beheaded following the English Civil War) and Charles II (who was restored to power after Oliver Cromwell died). It was under the last Stuart ruler, Queen Anne, that the Acts of Union were passed and Great Britain was founded.\n\nCapetians (France, 987–1328): The Capetians’ first monarch was Hugh Capet, who was elected king following the death of Louis V. Their notable rulers included Philip II, who went on the Third Crusade; Louis IX, a canonized saint; and Philip IV, who expelled the Jews of France in 1306 and arrested the Knights Templar in 1307. The rule of the Capetians ended when Philip IV’s sons failed to produce male heirs.\n\nValois (France, 1328–1589): The first Valois king of France was Philip VI, during whose reign the Hundred Years’ War began and the Black Death struck France. Notable Valois rulers included Louis XI, who acquired Burgundy; Francis I, who began the French Renaissance; and Henry III, whose assassination in the French Wars of Religion ended the Valois dynasty.\n\nBourbon (France, 1589–1792): The first Bourbon king was Henry IV, who was victorious in the War of the Three Henrys and issued the Edict of Nantes guaranteeing religious freedom. Notable Bourbon rulers included Louis XIV and Louis XVI (who was beheaded during the French Revolution). Following Napoleon’s fall, the Bourbons briefly ruled France again until the July Revolution of 1830. Spain has also been ruled mostly by the Bourbons since 1700."

    "content": "Wright Brothers (Orville: 1871–1948; Wilbur: 1867–1912) The Wright Brothers operated a bicycle repair shop in Dayton, Ohio before creating the first successful, powered, heavier-than-air, manned airplane. For several years, utilizing both a wind tunnel they built as well as test flights, they created and refined gliders before adding an engine to their design. Finally, on December 17, 1903, with Orville at the controls, the Flyer I made a 12-second flight at Kill Devil Hills near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. They made several more launches that day, with Wilbur staying aloft for 59 seconds on the fourth, and last, flight.\n\nCharles Lindbergh (1902–1974) In May 1927, Lindbergh made the first non-stop, solo, trans-Atlantic flight in the Spirit of St. Louis, a single-engine Ryan aircraft. Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field on Long Island and landed at Le Bourget Field in Paris 33½ hours later. Lindbergh married Anne Morrow in 1929, and the 1932 kidnapping and murder of their son Charles Jr. was called “The Crime of the Century”; ultimately, Bruno Hauptmann was convicted and executed. Prior to the U.S.’s entry into World War II, Lindbergh urged the U.S. to remain neutral and was active with the America First Committee, though during the war he flew 50 combat missions in the Pacific.\n\nAmelia Earhart (1897–1937?) More than 70 years after her disappearance, Earhart remains the most famous female aviator. In 1932 she became the first woman to make a trans-Atlantic solo flight, and three years later she became the first pilot of any gender to fly solo from Hawaii to California. In June 1937, she and navigator Fred Noonan embarked on a 29,000-mile, around-the-world flight in a twin-engine Lockheed Electra. They completed most of the journey, but became lost and eventually disappeared on the leg between Lae, New Guinea, and Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean. Speculation as to their ultimate fate continues to this day.\n\nChuck Yeager (1923–2020) During World War II, Yeager served in the U.S. Army Air Corps, earning “ace in a day” status by shooting down five German aircraft in one mission. On October 14, 1947, Yeager — piloting a Bell X-1 plane nicknamed (in tribute to his wife) Glamorous Glennis — became the first pilot to exceed the speed of sound in level flight. Profiled in Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, Yeager re-set the speed record at more than Mach 2 in 1953, and he remained active in the Air Force, even flying combat missions over Vietnam in his mid-40s.\n\nHoward Hughes (1905–1976) Subject of the 2004 film The Aviator, Hughes was a skilled aircraft pilot and designer who in the 1930s set speed records for flights across the United States and around the world. His most famous plane was the H-4 Hercules, or “Spruce Goose,” a massive wooden plane that to this day holds the record for longest wingspan on an operational craft. Meant to carry as many as 750 troops, Hughes himself was the pilot during its lone flight, a one-minute hop in 1947. Also a movie producer, Hughes is widely remembered for the various eccentricities, such as a pathological fear of germs and a refusal to cut his hair or nails, that he exhibited late in life.\n\nWiley Post (1898–1935) In 1931, Post and navigator Harold Gatty completed a circumnavigation of the globe aboard the Winnie Mae, an experience that the two wrote about in Around the World in Eight Days. Two years later, Post became the first solo pilot to complete an around-the-world trip. He then began investigating the possibility of high-altitude flight and, using a pressurized suit of his own design, reached a height of 50,000 feet and may have been the first to encounter and use the jet stream. Today, Post is mainly remembered for the circumstances of his death; while flying through Alaska with world-famous humorist Will Rogers as his passenger, Post crashed near Point Barrow, Alaska, and both men died.\n\nJimmy Doolittle (1896–1993) James H. Doolittle served as a flight instructor for the U.S. Army during World War I, and after the war became a celebrated race pilot, reaching a world-record speed of 296 miles per hour in 1932. Rejoining the military after Pearl Harbor, he personally led the “Doolittle Raid,” in which 16 B-25 bombers took off from the aircraft carrier USS Hornet and bombed the Japanese home islands in April 1942. Following the raid, Doolittle commanded the Eighth Air Force that launched massive bombing raids against Germany.\n\nManfred von Richthofen (1892–1918) Better known as the “Red Baron,” Richthofen was credited with shooting down 80 enemy aircraft, making him the top overall ace of World War I. Richthofen’s personal command, Jagdgeschwader 1, became known as “Richthofen’s Flying Circus” due to the variety of colors used on its planes. Richthofen died on April 21, 1918, when he was shot aboard his red Fokker triplane; though the Royal Air Force credited Canadian ace Roy Brown with the kill, it is more likely that he was brought down by ground fire from Australian troops in the trenches.\n\nEddie Rickenbacker (1890–1973) Before becoming a pilot, Rickenbacker achieved fame as a race car driver; “Fast Eddie” competed in the Indianapolis 500 on four separate occasions. During World War I, he joined the U.S. Army as a driver, but was admitted to flight school with the help of Colonel Billy Mitchell, and went on to win the Medal of Honor and finish as the top American ace of the war, with 26 kills. Rickenbacker bought the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1927 and Eastern Airlines in 1938. While on a military mission in the Pacific in 1942, Rickenbacker’s plane crashed, but he and all but one crewman survived a brutal 24-day ordeal aboard small life rafts.\n\nBurt Rutan (1943–present) A legendary aircraft designer, Rutan gained worldwide attention in 1986 when his Voyager plane, piloted by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager (no relation to Chuck Yeager), completed a non-stop, around-the-world flight without refueling. More recently, Rutan designed the Global Flyer, aboard which Steve Fossett made a solo, non-stop circumnavigation without refueling in 2005, and SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 won the $10 million Ansari X Prize by making the first privately funded space flights."

    "title": "World War Ii Battles",
    "content": "Battle of Britain (July 1940 – October 1940): The Battle of Britain saw the British Royal Air Force (RAF) defeat the German air force, known as the Luftwaffe, effectively saving Britain from a proposed German amphibious invasion codenamed Operation Sea Lion. The primary German fighter plane was the Messerschmitt Bf 109, which engaged in numerous dogfights against British pilots flying Hurricane and Spitfire aircraft. Effective use of radar helped to repel German forces, forcing the Luftwaffe into nighttime raids against civilian targets, a campaign known as the Blitz.\n\nBattle of Stalingrad (August 1942 – February 1943): With about two million casualties, the Battle of Stalingrad is often cited as the bloodiest battle in history. The battle arose out of Germany’s summer campaign to capture vital oil supplies in the Caucasus Mountains, but Friedrich Paulus’s 6th Army became bogged down in intense street fighting in the city, allowing Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov to launch Operation Uranus, which encircled Paulus’s men by defeating the Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian forces guarding their flank. In the final days of the battle, Hitler promoted Paulus to field marshal, a not-so-subtle suggestion that Paulus should either fight to the death or commit suicide, as no German field marshal had ever been captured; Paulus surrendered anyway.\n\nBattle of El Alamein (October 1942 – November 1942): The Second Battle of El Alamein marked the turning point in the African campaign. Named for an Egyptian coastal town 65 miles west of Alexandria, it saw the British Eighth Army under Bernard Montgomery defeat the German Afrika Korps under Erwin Rommel, preventing the Nazis from capturing the Suez Canal and oil fields in the Middle East. Following the battle, Allied forces landed in Morocco and Algeria as part of Operation Torch, and by May 1943 all Axis forces in North Africa had surrendered.\n\nBattle of Kursk (July 1943 – August 1943): Fought in western Russia, the Battle of Kursk was the largest tank battle in history, with about 6,000 tanks engaged. Thanks to a complex spy network, the Soviet leadership was well-informed about German plans to launch Operation Citadel against the Kursk salient, and constructed massive defensive fortifications. After the German advance was stopped, a successful Soviet counterattack was launched. The German Army never again was able to mount a major attack on the Eastern Front.\n\nD-Day (Operation Overlord) (June 6, 1944): The largest amphibious assault in history, as Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower’s forces attacked the German Atlantic Wall defenses on the beaches of Normandy, France. Due to his wife’s birthday, German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was absent at the start the invasion, which saw American forces land at Utah and Omaha Beaches, British forces land at Gold and Sword Beaches, and Canadian forces land at Juno Beach. After the landings, Allied forces erected prefabricated artificial Mulberry harbors to aid in transporting goods to France.\n\nBattle of the Bulge (December 1944 – January 1945): The Battle of the Bulge resulted from Germany’s last major offensive operation on the Western Front. The German plan to sweep through the Ardennes Forest and capture the port city Antwerp, Belgium, benefited from Allied aircraft being grounded due to poor weather. During the battle, English-speaking German troops under Otto Skorzeny attempted to disguise themselves as Allied troops and infiltrate enemy lines. German forces also besieged the Belgian town Bastogne and requested its surrender, to which U.S. Army Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe replied “Nuts!”; the siege was eventually lifted by forces commanded by George Patton.\n\nAttack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941): On what President Franklin Roosevelt declared would be “a date which will live in infamy,” Japanese carrier-based aircraft launched — without a formal declaration of war — a surprise attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island Oahu. The attack sank four battleships, most notably the USS Arizona, but all of the U.S. Navy’s carriers were at sea and were unattacked. Shortly after the attack, Japan began invasions of Guam, Wake Island, the Philippines, and the British colony of Singapore. On December 8, with only Montana Representative Jeannette Rankin dissenting, the U.S. Congress declared war on Japan.\n\nBattle of the Coral Sea (May 1942): Resulting from a Japanese plan to capture Port Moresby, New Guinea, the Battle of the Coral Sea was fought entirely by carrier-based aircraft, making it the first major naval battle in history in which the two opposing fleets never directly fired upon (or even sighted) each other. The U.S. Navy’s carrier Lexington was sunk, and the Yorktown heavily damaged, while the Japanese navy lost the light carrier Shoho and saw its large carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku damaged. Ultimately, the invasion of Port Moresby was cancelled and the temporary loss of two Japanese carriers gave the U.S. an edge at the subsequent Battle of Midway.\n\nBattle of Midway (June 1942): Universally considered the turning point in the Pacific Theater, the Battle of Midway saw the Japanese lose four aircraft carriers, a blow from which they never fully recovered. Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto planned to lure the U.S. fleet into a trap, but the Americans had broken the Japanese code, allowing them to pull off a stunning victory, with dive bombers from the Enterprise sinking the carriers Kaga, Akagi, and Hiryu, while those from the hastily-repaired Yorktown sank the carrier Soryu.\n\nBattle of Leyte Gulf (October 1944): By some measures the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf resulted from the Japanese Sho-Go plan to halt the American reconquest of the Philippines. The plan nearly worked when American Admiral William “Bull” Halsey was baited into moving all of his battleships and large carriers away from the landing site, but an American force of small escort carriers and destroyers held off a Japanese task force that included four battleships. Another Japanese force tried to pass through the Surigao Strait, but — in the last-ever combat between opposing battleships — the American Seventh Fleet crossed their ‘T’ and annihilated the force.\n\nBattle of Iwo Jima (February 1945 – March 1945): The Allies sought to capture Iwo Jima, a small island midway between the Mariana Islands and the Japanese home islands, to provide an airbase for the eventual invasion of Japan. Under the leadership of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the island’s defenders built a complex network of underground tunnels and well-camouflaged artillery pieces that enabled them to hold out for a month against vastly superior forces. The battle is best known for Joe Rosenthal’s photograph showing six American servicemen raising a flag atop Mount Suribachi.\n\nBattle of Okinawa (April 1945 – June 1945): The largest amphibious assault of the Pacific Theater, the Battle of Okinawa featured massive casualties among both combatants and civilians. The Japanese launched over 1,500 kamikaze attacks against the U.S. fleet, and even sent the massive battleship Yamato on a suicide mission; it was sunk by aircraft before reaching Okinawa. On the American side, both war correspondent Ernie Pyle and Lieutenant General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr., the commander-in-chief of the ground forces, were killed. Somewhat uniquely, the battle also saw large numbers of Japanese troops surrender, although many were native Okinawans forced into fighting."

    "title": "African Bodies Of Water",
    "content": "Nile River Usually cited as the longest river in the world, the Nile flows about 4,132 miles in a generally south-to-north direction from its headwaters in Burundi to Egypt’s Mediterranean Sea coast, where it forms a prototypical delta. Over 80% of the Nile’s flow comes from the shorter Blue Nile headstream, which arises from Ethiopia’s Lake Tana and meets the longer White Nile — whose headwaters include Lake Victoria — at Khartoum. At the first of the Nile’s six cataracts is the Aswan High Dam, which forms Lake Nasser and greatly reduces the annual floods.\n\nCongo River Africa’s second-longest river, it flows in a counterclockwise arc some 2,900 miles to the Atlantic Ocean. The Upper Congo’s principal sources are the Lualaba, which rises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Katanga province, and Zambia’s Chambeshi River. Boyoma Falls (formerly Stanley Falls), a section of seven cataracts near Kisangani, marks the beginning of the Congo River proper. Forming the Malebo Pool near the world capitals of Kinshasa and Brazzaville, the Lower Congo flows past Angola’s Cabinda exclave as it enters the ocean. Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness depicts the often cruel conditions the Congo basin endured as a Belgian colony.\n\nZambezi River Weaving across southern Africa, the Zambezi rises in eastern Angola, passes through Zambia, flows along the borders of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe, crosses through Mozambique, and enters the Indian Ocean’s Mozambique Channel near Chinde. Namibia’s Caprivi Strip was created to allow access to the Zambezi. The Cabora Bassa and Kariba Dams form large lakes of the same name. The most spectacular feature of the Zambezi is Victoria Falls, or Mosi-oa-Tunya (“the smoke that thunders”), which is over a mile wide and is the largest waterfall by flow rate in Africa.\n\nNiger River Africa’s third-longest, it flows in a great clockwise arc through Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria before entering the Gulf of Guinea. The medieval Mali and Songhai Empires were centered on the Niger, whose course was mapped by the Scottish explorer Mungo Park in the 1790s. In Nigeria, it receives the Benue River, its main tributary. The massive Niger Delta, known for its fisheries, wildlife, and petroleum, is an area of increasing social unrest.\n\nLimpopo River Rising as the Crocodile (or Krokodil) River in South Africa’s Witwatersrand region, it forms the Transvaal’s border with Botswana and Zimbabwe, then crosses through Mozambique. Deforestation in Mozambique contributed to massive flooding of the Limpopo in 2000. Perhaps the most famous description of the Limpopo comes from Rudyard Kipling, who in “The Elephant’s Child” referred to it as “the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees.”\n\nOkavango River The Okavango flows for about 1,000 miles from central Angola, through Namibia’s Caprivi Strip, and into the Kalahari Desert of Botswana. There, rather than flowing into the sea, it terminates in a massive inland swamp known as the Okavango Delta, an area that — especially during the wet season — teems with wildlife in an otherwise inhospitable region.\n\nLake Victoria Africa’s largest and the world’s second-largest freshwater lake by area, Lake Victoria lies along the Equator and is shared among Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. Located on a plateau between two rift valleys, its lone outlet is the Victoria Nile, a precursor of the White Nile. Named by the British explorer John Hanning Speke after Queen Victoria, the introduction of the predatory Nile perch in the 1950s has caused environmental degradation, sending many native cichlid species into extinction.\n\nLake Tanganyika Africa’s second-largest lake by area, it is also the second-deepest in the world, surpassed only by Lake Baikal. Due its extreme depth (over 4,700 feet), Lake Tanganyika contains seven times as much water as Lake Victoria. A source of the Lualaba River, it is shared by Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, and Zambia. On its Tanzanian shore is the town of Ujiji, at which Henry Morton Stanley “found” Dr. David Livingstone in 1871.\n\nLake Malawi (or Lake Nyasa) Africa’s third-largest lake by area and the southernmost of the Great Rift Valley lakes, it is wedged between the nations of Malawi, Tanzania, and Mozambique. Fed by the Ruhuhu River, its lone outlet is the Shire River, a tributary of the Zambezi. Lake Malawi contains hundreds of species of endemic fish, especially cichlids.\n\nLake Volta The largest man-made lake (by area) in the world, Lake Volta was created by the construction of Ghana’s Akosombo Dam across the Volta River in the 1960s. The lake covers the area where the Black Volta and White Volta rivers formerly converged. The Akosombo Dam can provide over a gigawatt of power, enough to supply nearby aluminum smelters utilizing the energy-intensive Hall-Héroult process and the needs of the rest of the country.\n\nLake Chad Formerly Africa’s fourth-largest lake, its surface area has been reduced by over 90% since the 1960s due to droughts and diversion of water from such sources as the Chari River. The lake is at the intersection of Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria, but most of the remaining water is in Chad and Cameroon. Lake Chad is very shallow and has no outlet, so seasonal rainfall causes large fluctuations in its area."

    "content": "Louvre Perhaps the world’s most famous museum, the Musée du Louvre is located on the right bank of the Seine River in the heart of Paris. Housed in the Louvre Palace, which was a royal residence until 1682, the Louvre was permanently opened to the public as a museum by the French Revolutionary government in 1793. During renovations carried out in the 1980s, a controversial steel-and-glass pyramid designed by I. M. Pei was installed at its entrance. Works housed within the Sully, Richelieu, and Denon Wings of the Louvre include ancient Greek sculptures such as the Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo, Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, and Eugène Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People.\n\nMuseo del Prado In 1785, Spanish King Charles III commissioned a building to house a natural history museum, but his grandson Ferdinand VII completed the Prado as an art museum in 1819. Deriving its name from the Spanish for “meadow,” the Prado’s holdings include not only what is universally regarded as the best collection of Spanish paintings, but also a number of works from Flemish masters, such as Diego Velázquez’s Las Meninas, Francisco Goya’s The Third of May, 1808, and Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights.\n\nUffizi Gallery Located in Florence, Italy, the Uffizi Gallery was originally designed by Giorgio Vasari to serve as offices for the Florentine magistrates under Cosimo de’ Medici — hence the name uffizi, meaning “offices.” After Cosimo I died in 1574, the new grand duke, Francis I, commissioned the conversion of its top floor into a galley. Its outstanding Renaissance holdings include The Birth of Venus and La Primavera, both by Sandro Botticelli, and Titian’s Venus of Urbino.\n\nRijksmuseum RYKES-“museum” Located in Amsterdam, this is the national museum of The Netherlands. Currently housed in a Gothic Revival building designed by P. J. H. Cuypers and completed in 1885, its most distinguished works include Rembrandt’s Night Watch, Franz Hals’s The Merry Drinker, and Jan Vermeer’s The Milkmaid.\n\nHermitage Founded in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1764 by Catherine the Great, its buildings include the Winter Palace, which was once the residence of Russia’s tsars. Its most famous pieces include Rembrandt’s The Return of the Prodigal Son and Henri Matisse’s Red Room.\n\nTate Originally known as the National Gallery of British Art when opened in 1897, it was renamed for its benefactor, sugar tycoon Sir Henry Tate. The original Tate Gallery has been renamed Tate Britain, and there are now three additional branches: Tate Modern in London, Tate Liverpool, and Tate St. Ives in Cornwall. The Tate awards the Turner Prize, a highly publicized award for British artists, and its collection includes Whaam! by Roy Lichtenstein and many works by J. M. W. Turner.\n\nGuggenheim The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is located in Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Founded as “The Museum of Non-Objective Painting,” in 1959 it moved into its current home, a Frank Lloyd Wright building that features a spiral ramp connecting the exhibition areas. Focusing on modern art, its holdings include the world’s largest collection of paintings by Wassily Kandinsky.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art Located on the edge of Central Park and colloquially known as “the Met,” its main building on Fifth Avenue was designed by Richard Morris Hunt. Its collection includes El Greco’s View of Toledo, Jacques-Louis David’s The Death of Socrates, and John Singer Sargent’s Madame X.\n\nMuseum of Modern Art Better known as “MoMA” and situated in Manhattan, it has been connected with the Rockefeller family since its founding in 1929. Its collection includes Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night, Pablo Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, Salvador Dalí’s The Persistence of Memory, and Piet Mondrian’s Broadway Boogie-Woogie.\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago Located on the western edge of Grant Park in Chicago, the main building of the Art Institute was built for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition and features two lion statues at its entrance (which are often decorated for special occasions, e.g. with jerseys when Chicago sports teams are in the playoffs). It has an outstanding collection of French Impressionist and American works such as Georges Seurat’s A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s At the Moulin Rouge, Grant Wood’s American Gothic, and Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks.\n\nGuggenheim Museum Bilbao The Guggenheim Bilbao opened in 1997 and is — like its sister instutition in New York — less famous for its collection than its building, a Frank Gehry design that seems to be an abstract sculpture all its own. Richard Serra’s The Matter of Time is permanently installed here.\n\nThe National Gallery in Trafalgar Square in London houses a synoptic collection of pre-1900 paintings assembled by government purchase and donation. It is home to British masterpieces including John Constable’s The Haywain and both Rain, Steam and Speed and The Fighting Temeraire by J. M. W. Turner. The museum also boasts several major highlights of European painting, from arguably the best known of Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers series to exemplar Baroque works like Caravaggio’s Supper at Emmaus, The Judgment of Paris by Peter Paul Rubens, and the Rokeby Venus of Diego Velázquez. Major works of the Italian and north European Renaissance are also represented, including Jan van Eyck’s The Arnolfini Wedding, Hans Holbein’s The Ambassadors, Titian’s Bacchus and Ariadne, Raphael’s Portrait of Pope Julius II, and the later of Leonardo’s two versions of Madonna of the Rocks."

    "title": "Ancient Philosophers",
    "content": "Socrates (c. 469 BC–399 BC) We have no writings from Socrates’s own hand, and know about him largely from the dialogues of his student Plato. Proclaiming his own ignorance of all things, Socrates went around Athens engaging in question-and-answer sessions to search for truths or draw out contradictions (the “Socratic method”). The Athenian state disapproved of his conduct; he was put on trial for corrupting the city’s youth, and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock. Socrates’ trial, imprisonment, and death are recounted in Plato’s Apology, Crito, and Phaedo, respectively.\n\nPlato (c. 429 BC–347 BC) Plato’s Socratic dialogues are our main source both for Socrates’s philosophy and his own; Plato often put his own thoughts in Socrates’ mouth. Plato’s dialogues include the Republic (about justice and the ideal city-state), the Symposium (about the nature of love), and the Meno (about whether virtue can be taught). Plato believed in a world of “forms”—or ideal versions of real things that lie beyond the human senses—which he discussed in such works as the Phaedo. Plato founded a school called the Academy, from which we get the common word.\n\nAristotle (c. 384 BC–322 BC) Aristotle was a student of Plato; in turn, Aristotle was a tutor to Alexander the Great. Many of his works come to us in the form of lectures he gave at his school, known as the Lyceum. His philosophical output includes the Nicomachean Ethics, which argues that virtues consist in a “golden mean” between two extremes; the Physics, which describes motion and change in terms of “four causes” that make a given thing what it is; and the Metaphysics, which describes the structure of reality. Aristotle’s Poetics discusses the types of drama and considers an effect of tragedies known as catharsis, or the purging of bad feelings.\n\nConfucius (or Kong Fu Zi) (6th century BC) A pivotal thinker from China’s Spring and Autumn period, Confucius’s views on proper conduct and filial piety influence China to this day. Many sayings attributed to Confucius were compiled by his disciples following his death in a text known as the Analects. Confucius put much importance on ren, the inner state which allows one to behave compassionately toward others, and on a concept called li, which can help individuals attain ren.\n\nLao Tzu (also given as Lao Tse or Laozi) (dates unknown, 6th century BC) is a quasi-mythical thinker of the Taoist tradition, to whom the pivotal Tao te Ching is attributed. Concepts associated with him include that of the Tao, or “the way,” and wu wei, or a life of non-action in accordance with the Tao. In later centuries, Lao Tzu was accorded godlike status as one of the Three Pure Ones of Taoism, and is frequently depicted as an old man with a donkey. To Lao Tzu is attributed the quote “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”\n\nDiogenes (c. 410s BC–323 BC) Diogenes of Sinope was a student of Antisthenes, who founded the ancient school of philosophy known as Cynicism. (The term “cynic” comes from the Greek for “dog-like,” and is thought to have originated as an insult to the school’s members.) The Cynics rejected conventional social norms in search of a truly virtuous life. Diogenes himself was something of an eccentric—according to legend, he lived in a tub or a barrel on the street, and wandered Athens holding a lamp in his futile search for an honest man.\n\nEpicurus (341 BC–270 BC) Epicurus’s namesake school, Epicureanism, believed that pleasure was the highest (or only) good, and that the absence of pain (aponia) was the highest pleasure. They also believed that human happiness consisted of a kind of tranquillity known as ataraxia. Critics of Epicureanism accused his school of promoting hedonism and making selfishness into a good, though Epicureans did not believe themselves to be hedonists.\n\nZeno of Elea (c. 490 BC–430 BC) Zeno of Elea was a student of Parmenides, who founded the Eleatic school in a Greek colony of the Italian peninsula. He is most famous today for “Zeno’s paradoxes,” the best-known of which involve an arrow in flight and a race between Achilles and a tortoise. Zeno’s paradoxes purport to show that physical movement is impossible, since any attempt to travel a distance must be preceded by moving half that distance, which must be preceded by moving half of half that distance, and so on. (Zeno of Elea is not to be confused with Zeno of Citium, who founded the philosophical school of Stoicism two centuries later.)\n\nThales (c. 620 BC–546 BC) Thales was a pre-Socratic thinker from the Greek colony of Miletus who many consider to be the “first philosopher.” Rejecting mythical explanations of the universe’s nature, he believed that the first principle of all existence, the natural element from which all things emerged, was water. Thales was also a civil engineer and mathematician, and is credited with discovering that if a circle goes through all three vertices of a triangle and one side of the triangle is a diameter of the circle, then the triangle is a right triangle. He is sometimes thought of as the founder of a “Milesian school” of philosophy, whose other members include Anaximander and Anaximenes.\n\nCicero (106 BC–43 BC) Though he is better remembered today for his role in the political life of the Roman Republic, Marcus Tullius Cicero (sometimes known as “Tully”) was also a significant philosopher. He described the ideal state in such dialogues as On the Republic and On the Laws, while he discussed Epicurean and Stoic views on religion in On the Nature of the Gods. Through the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Cicero was considered one of the most important of ancient philosophers. Indeed, Saint Augustine asserted that he turned to philosophy as a result of reading a now-lost work by Cicero known as the Hortensius."

    "content": "West Side Story (Leonard Bernstein; Stephen Sondheim; Arthur Laurents; 1957): Riff and Bernardo lead two rival gangs: the blue-collar Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks. Tony, a former Jet, falls in love with Bernardo’s sister Maria and vows to stop the fighting, but he kills Bernardo after Bernardo kills Riff in a “rumble.” Maria’s suitor Chino shoots Tony, and the two gangs come together. Notable songs include “America,” “Tonight,” “Somewhere,” “I Feel Pretty,” and “Gee, Officer Krupke.” Adapted from Romeo and Juliet, it was made into an Academy Award-winning 1961 film starring Natalie Wood.\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber; Charles Hart & Richard Stilgoe; Richard Stilgoe & Andrew Lloyd Webber; 1986): At the Paris Opera in 1881, the mysterious Phantom lures the soprano Christine Daaé to his lair (“The Music of the Night”). Christine falls in love with the opera’s new patron, Raoul, so the Phantom drops a chandelier and kidnaps Christine. They kiss, but he disappears, leaving behind only his white mask. Adapted from the 1909 novel of the same name by Gaston Leroux, it is the longest-running show in Broadway history.\n\nMy Fair Lady (Frederick Loewe; Alan Jay Lerner; Alan Jay Lerner; 1956): As part of a bet with his friend Colonel Pickering, the phonetics professor Henry Higgins transforms the Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle into a proper lady.

Eliot; 1981): The Jellicle tribe of cats roams the streets of London. They introduce the audience to various members: Rum Tum Tugger, Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Mr. Mistoffelees, and Old Deuteronomy. Old Deuteronomy must choose a cat to be reborn, and he chooses the lowly Grizabella after she sings “Memory.” It is adapted from Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot.\n\nEvita (Andrew Lloyd Webber; Tim Rice; Tim Rice; 1978): Che (possibly Che Guevara, but it’s also South American slang for just “a guy”) narrates the life story of Eva “Evita” Perón, a singer and actress who marries Juan Perón. Juan becomes President of Argentina, and Eva’s charity work makes her immensely popular among her people (“Don’t Cry for Me Argentina”) before her death from cancer. It was made into a 1996 film starring Madonna and Antonio Banderas.\n\nThe Mikado (Arthur Sullivan; W. S. Gilbert; 1885): The Mikado (Emperor of Japan) has made flirting a capital crime in Titipu, so the people have appointed an ineffectual executioner named Ko-Ko.

    "title": "Deserts",
    "content": "Antarctica (5.4 million mi2) Because it is covered with (solid) water, it is somewhat surprising that Antarctica is considered a desert, but it is classified as such due to its lack of precipitation. Players should be familiar with its tallest mountain, Vinson Massif in the Ellsworth Mountains; its active volcano Mount Erebus; the surrounding Ross and Weddell Seas; and the Ross Ice Shelf. The Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen was the first to reach the South Pole (1911); a month later, Robert Scott reached it, but Scott died on the return trip. Ernest Shackleton had to abandon his ship, the Endurance, during an attempt to cross Antarctica on foot.\n\nSahara Desert (Northern Africa; 3.5 million mi2) The Sahara is the world’s second largest desert, but its largest hot desert. The Atlas Mountains bound the western Sahara on the north, and the Sahel — a savannah-like strip — bounds it on the south. It is dominated by rocky regions (hamada), sand seas (ergs), and salt flats (shatt) and dry river valleys (wadi) that are subject to flash floods. The Berber and Tuareg peoples are native to the Sahara.\n\nAtacama Desert (Chile; 70,000 mi2) The Atacama’s chief claim to fame is the rain shadow of the Andes, which makes it the driest hot desert in the world. The desert was the primary bone of contention in the War of the Pacific (1879–1883; Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia) that sought to control its nitrate resources, which were necessary for the production of explosives.\n\nKalahari Desert (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa; 360,000 mi2) The Kalahari is a large region, not all of which is arid enough to qualify as a desert. It is known for its red sand, large game reserves (meerkats, gemsbok, springbok, steenbok), and mineral deposits (notably uranium). Its San Bushmen speak a click language.\n\nMojave moh-HAH-vay Desert (mostly California, and some of Arizona, Utah, and Nevada; 25,000 mi2) The Mojave is bounded by the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountain ranges along the San Andreas and Garlock Faults. It is between the Great Basin and the Sonoran Desert, and it contains the lowest and driest point of North America, Death Valley. It is most strongly associated with the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia).\n\nGobi Desert (China and Mongolia; 500,000 mi2) The Gobi, Asia’s second largest desert (after the Arabian Desert), is bounded on the north by the Altai Mountains. It is known for its role in the Silk Road trading route and the Nemegt Basin, where fossilized dinosaur eggs and human artifacts have been found.\n\nRub’ al-Khali (Arabian Peninsula; 250,000 mi2) Its name means “Empty Quarter” in English, and it is sometimes considered the most inhospitable place on earth. It is known for the world’s largest oil field, the Ghawar, and for once being part of the frankincense trade.\n\nNamib Desert (Namibia and Angola; 30,000 mi2) The Namib, a coastal desert, is known for its bizarre Welwitschia and medicinal Hoodia plants. It is thought to be the oldest desert in the world.\n\nPainted Desert (Northern Arizona; 7,500 mi2) The Painted Desert, which is shared by Grand Canyon and Petrified Forest National Parks, is known for its colorful, banded rock formations.\n\nTaklamakan Desert (China; 105,000 mi2) The Taklamakan is an extremely cold, sandy desert known for splitting the Silk Road into branches running north and south of it. It is bounded by the Kunlun, Pamir, and Tian Shan mountain ranges.\n\nGreat Sandy Desert (Western Australia; 140,000 mi2) Part of the Western Desert, and the ninth largest in the world."

    "title": "Sculptors",
    "content": "Michelangelo (1475–1564): A Florentine “Renaissance man” also known for architecture (the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica), painting (The Last Judgment and the Sistine Chapel ceiling), poetry, and military engineering. His sculpted masterpieces include David, a Pietà, Bacchus, and a number of pieces for the tomb of Pope Julius II (including Dying Slave and Moses). He preferred to work in Carraran marble.\n\nAuguste Rodin (1840–1917): A French sculptor known for stormy relationships with “the establishment” of the École des Beaux-Arts ay-kohl day boh-zar and his mistress, fellow artist Camille Claudel. His works include The Age of Bronze, Honoré de Balzac, The Burghers of Calais, and a massive pair of doors for the Museum of Decorative Arts (the Gates of Hell) inspired by Dante’s Inferno. That latter work included his most famous piece, The Thinker.\n\nGian Lorenzo Bernini (1598–1680): A Roman who — with the rarely asked-about Francesco Borromini — defined the Baroque movement in sculpture. Bernini is principally known for his freestanding works, including David and The Ecstasy of St. Theresa. Bernini’s David differs from that of Michelangelo in that the hero is shown “in motion,” having twisted his body to sling the rock. Bernini is also known for his massive fountains in Rome, including the Triton and the Fountain of the Four Rivers.\n\nDonatello (1386–1466): A Florentine sculptor who helped define Renaissance sculpture as distinct from that of the Gothic period. He is known for St. Mark and St. George in the Orsanmichele OR-sahn mee-KAY-lay (a Florentine church), the bald Zuccone (which means “pumpkin-head,” though it depicts the prophet Habbakuk), and the first equestrian statue to be cast since Roman times, the Gattamelata in Padua. He is also known for mastering the low-relief form schiacciato.\n\nLorenzo Ghiberti (1378–1455): A Florentine sculptor and goldsmith who taught both Donatello and Filippo Brunelleschi. He is best known for two pairs of bronze doors on the Florence Baptistery (associated with the Duomo, or Florentine Cathedral). He produced a single, low-relief panel to win a 1401 competition (defeating Brunelleschi) for the commission to design the 28 panels for the north doors. After that, he was given another commission to design ten panels for the east doors. This latter work, by far his most famous, was dubbed the “Gates of Paradise” by Michelangelo.\n\nGutzon Borglum (1867–1941): An American known for crafting Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota. He is also known for The Mares of Diomedes and an unfinished (and later replaced) tribute to Confederate heroes on Stone Mountain in Georgia.\n\nPhidias (c. 480 – c. 430 BC): An Athenian considered the greatest of all Classical sculptors. He created the chryselephantine (gold and ivory) Statue of Zeus at Olympia (one of the Wonders of the Ancient World, now lost) and the statue of Athena in the Parthenon (now lost). He was supported by money from the Delian League (that is, the Athenian Empire) run by his friend Pericles; he was later ruined by charges of corruption generally considered to be part of a political campaign against Pericles.\n\nConstantin Brâncuși (1876–1957): A Romanian sculptor who was a major figure in Modernism. He is best known for The Kiss (not to be confused with the Rodin work or the Klimt painting), Sleeping Muse, and Bird in Space. U.S. customs tried to tax his works as “industrial products” since they refused to recognize them as art, though Brâncuși won a court case over the matter.\n\nDaniel Chester French (1850–1931): An American who created The Minute Man for Concord, Massachusetts and Standing Lincoln for the Nebraska state capitol, but who is best known for the seated statue in the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nFrédéric-Auguste Bartholdi (1834–1904): A French sculptor primarily known as the creator of Liberty Enlightening the World, better known as the Statue of Liberty. He also executed The Lion of Belfort and a statue of the Marquis de Lafayette in New York’s Union Square."

    "title": "Treaties",
    "content": "The Treaty of Versailles (1919) officially ended World War I between the Allies and Germany. It was signed at its namesake French palace after the Paris Peace Conference. It is noted for the “Big Four” (Woodrow Wilson, David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau, and Vittorio Orlando) who headed the Allies’ delegations, discussions of Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points (particularly the League of Nations), and its controversial disarmament, war guilt, and reparations clauses. The conference was also notable for up-and-coming world figures who attended (John Maynard Keynes, Ho Chi Minh, Jan Smuts, etc.).\n\nThe Treaty of Utrecht (1713) was a series of treaties signed in the Dutch city of Utrecht that (mostly) ended the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714). They were signed by France and Spain for one side and by Britain, Savoy, and the United Provinces (The Netherlands) for the other. The treaty confirmed a Bourbon prince (Philip, Duke of Anjou) on the Spanish throne, ending Habsburg control, but took steps to prevent the French and Spanish thrones from being merged. Some Spanish possessions — including Sicily, the Spanish Netherlands, Naples, and Gibraltar — were given to the victors.\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent (1814) ended the War of 1812 between the U.S. and Britain. It was signed in the Belgian city Ghent but, due to the distances involved, could not prevent the Battle of New Orleans two weeks later. The treaty made no boundary changes and had minimal effect; both sides were ready for peace and considered the war a futile and fruitless endeavor.\n\nThe Treaty of Portsmouth (1905) ended the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). It was signed at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine after negotiations brokered by Theodore Roosevelt (for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize). Japan had dominated the war and received an indemnity, the Liaodong Peninsula in Manchuria, and half of Sakhalin Island, but the treaty was widely condemned in Japan because the public had expected more.\n\nThe Adams-Onís Treaty (1819) settled a boundary dispute between the U.S. and Spain that arose following the Louisiana Purchase. It was negotiated by then-Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and most notably sold Florida to the U.S. in exchange for the payment of its citizens’ claims against Spain. It also delineated the U.S.-Spain border to the Pacific Ocean leading to its alternate name, the Transcontinental Treaty.\n\nThe Camp David Accords (1978) were negotiated at the presidential retreat Camp David by Egypt’s Anwar Sadat and Israel’s Menachem Begin; they were brokered by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. They led to a peace treaty the next year that returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, guaranteed Israeli access to the Red Sea and Suez Canal, and more-or-less normalized diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries. This isolated Egypt from the other Arab countries and led to Sadat’s assassination in 1981.\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) ended the Mexican-American War (1846–1848) and was signed in its namesake neighborhood of Mexico City. Its most significant result was the “Mexican Cession” transferring California, Nevada, Utah, and parts of four other states to the U.S. It also made the Rio Grande the boundary between Texas and Mexico.\n\nThe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918) was a “separate peace” signed by the Bolshevik government of the new USSR and Germany. The USSR needed to make peace to focus on defeating the “Whites” (royalists) in the Russian Civil War, and it gave up Ukraine, Belarus, and the three Baltic countries after Germany invaded, an outcome worse than a German offer which chief Soviet negotiator Leon Trotsky had rejected. The treaty was negotiated in Brest (in what is now Belarus) and was nullified by the subsequent Treaty of Versailles following Germany’s defeat.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) ostensibly divided the New World (and, in later interpretations, the entire world) between Spain and Portugal. It resulted from a bull by (Spanish-born) Pope Alexander VI granting lands to Spain and established a line west of the Cape Verde islands between future Spanish possessions (west) and Portuguese possessions (east). The line passed through Brazil, allowing the Portuguese to establish a colony there, while Spain received the rest of the Americas. Endless wrangling and repeated revisions ensued.\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia (1648) is the collective name for two treaties ending the Thirty Years’ War that were signed by the Holy Roman Empire, minor German states, Spain, France, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic. It confirmed the principle of “cuius regio eius religio” (that a ruler’s religion determined that of his country) introduced by the Peace of Augsburg, but mandated relative tolerance of other (Christian) faiths. It adjusted the borders of German states and strengthened their princes with respect to the Emperor, and transferred most of Lorraine and some of Alsace to France.\n\nThe Lateran Treaty (1929) created the independent country of the Vatican City, made Catholicism the state religion of Italy (ended in 1984), and determined the proper remuneration for Church property taken by Italy. It was signed by Benito Mussolini and a representative of Pope Pius XI in the namesake papal residence, and ended the so-called “Roman Question” that arose out of the unification of Italy and the dissolution of the Papal States.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris of 1898 ended the Spanish-American War and transferred Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico to the U.S. while making Cuba (ostensibly) independent. The treaty was the beginning of American imperialism overseas, and it underwent a lengthy and contentious ratification."

    "title": "Mathematicians",
    "content": "The work of Isaac Newton (1643–1727, English) in pure math includes generalizing the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, doing the first rigorous manipulation with power series, and creating Newton’s method for finding roots of differentiable functions. He is best known, however, for a lengthy feud between British and Continental mathematicians over whether he or Gottfried Leibniz invented calculus (whose differential aspect Newton called the method of fluxions). It is now generally accepted that they both did, independently.\n\nEuclid (c. 300 BC, Alexandrian Greek) is principally known for the Elements, a textbook on geometry and number theory, that has been used for over 2,000 years and which grounds essentially all of what is taught in modern high school geometry classes. The Elements includes five postulates that describe what is now called Euclidean space (the usual geometric space we work in); the fifth postulate — also called the parallel postulate — can be broken to create spherical and hyperbolic geometries, which are collectively called non-Euclidean geometries. The Elements also includes a proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855, German) is considered the “Prince of Mathematicians” for his extraordinary contributions to every major branch of mathematics. His Disquisitiones Arithmeticae systematized number theory and stated the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (every integer greater than 1 has a prime factorization that is unique notwithstanding the order of the factors). In his doctoral dissertation, he proved the fundamental theorem of algebra (every non-constant polynomial has at least one root in the complex numbers), though that proof is not considered rigorous enough for modern standards. He later proved the law of quadratic reciprocity, and the prime number theorem (that the number of primes less than n is is approximately n divided by the natural logarithm of n). Gauss may be most famous for the (possibly apocryphal) story of intuiting the formula for the summation of an arithmetic sequence when his primary-school teacher gave him the task — designed to waste his time — of adding the first 100 positive integers.\n\nArchimedes (287–212 BC, Syracusan Greek) is best known for his “eureka” moment, in which he realized he could use density considerations to determine the purity of a gold crown; nonetheless, he was the preeminent mathematician of ancient Greece. He found the ratios between the surface areas and volumes of a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder, accurately estimated pi, and developed a calculus-like technique to find the area of a circle, his method of exhaustion.\n\nGottfried Leibniz (1646–1716, German) is known for his independent invention of calculus and the ensuing priority dispute with Isaac Newton. Most modern calculus notation, including the integral sign and the use of d to indicate a differential, originated with Leibniz. He also did work with the binary number system and did fundamental work in establishing boolean algebra and symbolic logic.\n\nPierre de Fermat (1601–1665, French) is remembered for his contributions to number theory including his little theorem, which states that if p is a prime number and a is any number at all, then ap – a will be divisible by p. He studied Fermat primes, which are prime numbers that can be written as 22n + 1 for some integer n, but is probably most famous for his “last theorem,” which he wrote in the margin of Arithmetica by the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus with a note that “I have discovered a marvelous proof of this theorem that this margin is too small to contain.” The theorem states that there is no combination of positive integers x, y, z, and n, with n > 2, such that xn + yn = zn, and mathematicians struggled for over 300 years to find a proof until Andrew Wiles completed one in 1995. (It is generally believed that Fermat did not actually have a valid proof.) Fermat and Blaise Pascal corresponded about probability theory.\n\nLeonhard Euler (1707–1783, Swiss) is known for his prolific output and the fact that he continued to produce seminal results even after going blind. He invented graph theory by solving the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem, which asked whether there was a way to travel a particular arrangement of bridges so that you would cross each bridge exactly once. (He proved that it was impsosible to do so.) Euler introduced the modern notation for e, an irrational number about equal to 2.718, which is now called Euler’s number in his honor (but don’t confuse it for Euler’s constant, which is different); he also introduced modern notation for i, a square root of –1, and for trigonometric functions. He proved Euler’s formula, which relates complex numbers and trigonometric functions: ei x = cos x + i sin x, of which a special case is the fact that ei π = –1, which Richard Feynman called “the most beautiful equation in mathematics” because it links four of math’s most important constants.\n\nKurt Gödel (1906–1978, Austrian) was a logician best known for his two incompleteness theorems, which state that if a formal logical system is powerful enough to express ordinary arithmetic, it must contain statements that are true yet unprovable. Gödel developed paranoia late in life and eventually refused to eat because he feared his food had been poisoned; he died of starvation.\n\nAndrew Wiles (1953–present, British) is best known for proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture that all rational semi-stable elliptic curves are modular forms. When combined with work already done by other mathematicians, this immediately implied Fermat’s last theorem (see above).\n\nWilliam Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865, Irish) is known for a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers, with six square roots of –1 (±i, ±j, and ±k), called the quaternions."

    "title": "Operas",
    "content": "Aida (Giuseppe Verdi, Antonio Ghislanzoni, 1871): Aida is an Ethiopian princess who is held captive in Egypt. She falls in love with the Egyptian general Radamès and convinces him to run away with her; unfortunately, he is caught by the high priest Ramphis and a jealous Egyptian princess, Amneris. Radamès is buried alive, but finds that Aida has snuck into the tomb to join him.\n\nCarmen (Georges Bizet, Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, 1875): Carmen is a young gypsy who works in a cigarette factory in Seville. She is arrested by the corporal Don José for fighting, but cajoles him into letting her escape. They meet again at an inn where she tempts him into challenging his captain; that treason forces him to join a group of smugglers. In the final act, the ragtag former soldier encounters Carmen at a bullfight where her lover Escamillo is competing (the source of the “Toreador Song”) and stabs her. The libretto was based on a novel by Prosper Merimée.\n\nThe Marriage of Figaro (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Lorenzo Da Ponte, 1786): Figaro and Susanna are servants of Count Almaviva who plan to marry, but this plan is complicated by the older Marcellina who wants to wed Figaro, the Count — who has made unwanted advances to Susanna —, and Don Bartolo, who has a loan that Figaro has sworn he will repay before he marries. The issues are resolved with a series of complicated schemes that involve impersonating other characters, including the page Cherubino. The opera is based on a comedy by Pierre de Beaumarchais. Be careful: Many of the same characters also appear in The Barber of Seville!\n\nThe Barber of Seville (Gioacchino Rossini, Cesare Sterbini, 1816): Count Almaviva loves Rosina, the ward of Dr. Bartolo. Figaro (who brags about his wit in “Largo al factotum”) promises to help him win the girl. He tries the guise of the poor student Lindoro, a drunken soldier, and then a replacement music teacher, all of which are penetrated by Dr. Bartolo. Eventually they succeed by climbing in with a ladder and bribing the notary who was to marry Rosina to Dr. Bartolo himself. This opera is also based on a work of Pierre de Beaumarchais and is a prequel to The Marriage of Figaro.\n\nWilliam Tell (Gioacchino Rossini, Étienne de Jouy and Hippolyte Bis, 1829): William Tell is a 14th-century Swiss patriot who wishes to end Austria’s domination of his country. In the first act he helps Leuthold, a fugitive, escape the Austrian governor, Gessler. In the third act, Gessler has placed his hat on a pole and ordered the men to bow to it. When Tell refuses, Gessler takes his son, Jemmy, and forces Tell to shoot an apple off his son’s head. Tell succeeds, but is arrested anyway. In the fourth act, he escapes from the Austrians and his son sets their house on fire as a signal for the Swiss to rise in revolt. The opera was based on a play by Friedrich von Schiller.\n\nDon Giovanni (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Lorenzo Da Ponte, 1787): Don Giovanni (the Italian form of “Don Juan”) attempts to seduce Donna Anna, but is discovered by her father, the Commendatore, whom he kills in a swordfight. Later in the act, his servant Leporello recounts his master’s 2,000-odd conquests in the “Catalogue Aria.” Further swordfights and assignations occur prior to the final scene, in which a statue of the Commendatore comes to life, knocks on the door to the room in which Don Giovanni is feasting, and then opens a chasm that takes him down to hell.\n\nSalome (Richard Strauss based on the play by Oscar Wilde, 1905): Jokanaan (John the Baptist) is imprisoned in the dungeons of King Herod. Herod’s 15-year-old step-daughter Salome becomes obsessed with the prisoner’s religious passion and is incensed when he ignores her advances. Later in the evening Herod orders Salome to dance for him (the “Dance of the Seven Veils”), but she refuses until he promises her “anything she wants.” She asks for the head of Jokanaan and eventually receives it, after which a horrified Herod orders her to be killed; his soldiers crush her with their shields.\n\nBoris Godunov (Modest Mussorgsky, 1874): The opera’s prologue shows Boris Godunov, the chief adviser of Ivan the Terrible, being pressured to assume the throne after Ivan’s two children die. In the first act the religious novice Grigori decides that he will impersonate that younger son, Dmitri (the [first] “false Dmitri”), whom, it turns out, Boris had killed. Grigori raises a general revolt and Boris’ health falls apart as he is taunted by military defeats and dreams of the murdered tsarevich. The opera ends with Boris dying in front of the assembled boyars (noblemen).\n\nLa bohème (Giacomo Puccini, Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, 1896): This opera tells the story of four extremely poor friends who live in the Latin (i.e., Students’) Quarter of Paris: Marcello the artist, Rodolfo the poet, Colline the philosopher, and Schaunard the musician. Rodolfo meets the seamstress Mimì who lives next door when her single candle is blown out and needs to be relit. Marcello is still attached to Musetta, who had left him for the rich man Alcindoro. In the final act, Marcello and Rodolfo have separated from their lovers, but cannot stop thinking about them. Musetta bursts into their garret apartment and tells them that Mimi is dying of consumption (tuberculosis); when they reach her, she is already dead. La bohème was based on a novel by Henry Murger and, in turn, formed the basis of the hit 1996 musical Rent by Jonathan Larson.\n\nMadama Butterfly (Giacomo Puccini, Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, 1904): The American naval lieutenant Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton is stationed in Nagasaki where, with the help of the broker Goro, he weds the young girl Cio-Cio-San (Madame Butterfly) with a marriage contract with a cancellation clause. He later returns to America, leaving Cio-Cio-San to raise their son “Trouble” (whom she will rename “Joy” upon his return). When Pinkerton and his new American wife Kate do return, Cio-Cio-San gives them her son and stabs herself with her father’s dagger. The opera is based on a play by David Belasco."

    "title": "Classes Of Particles",
    "content": "Leptons are one of the classes of “fundamental particles” (meaning that they cannot be broken down into smaller particles). There are six “flavors” of leptons: the electron, the muon, the tauon, the electron neutrino (usually just called “the neutrino”), the muon neutrino, and the tauon neutrino. The three neutrinos are neutral and nearly massless (they were once thought to be entirely massless), while the other three have a charge of –1. All neutrinos are fermions, and the total number of leptons is always conserved (counting regular leptons as +1 particle and anti-leptons as –1 particle). The word “lepton” comes from the Greek for “light” (the opposite of “heavy,” not illumination), even though the muon and tauon are relatively massive.\n\nQuarks are another class of fundamental particle. They also come in six flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top (occasionally called “truth”), and bottom (occasionally “beauty”). The up, charm, and top quarks have a charge of +2/3, while the down, strange, and bottom have a charge of –1/3. All quarks are fermions, and they combine in pairs to form mesons and in triples to form baryons. The enormous mass of the top quark (178 GeV) made it difficult to create in particle accelerators, but its discovery in 1995 confirmed an essential element of the Standard Model of particle physics. The name “quark” comes from the line “Three quarks for Muster Mark” in Finnegans Wake that appealed to Murray Gell-Mann. The study of quarks (and of the strong nuclear force) is quantum chromodynamics.\n\nBaryons are composite (i.e., non-fundamental) particles made from three quarks. The most common examples are the proton (two up quarks and one down quark) and the neutron (two down quarks and one up). All baryons are fermions. Quarks possess a characteristic called “color” (which has nothing to do with visual color) which can be either red, green, or blue (arbitrary names; again, no relation to the colors we see). A baryon must have one quark of each color so that the “total color” (analogous to mixing red, green, and blue light) is colorless (i.e., “white”). The word “baryon” comes from the Greek for “heavy.” The total number of baryons is conserved (again, counting anti-baryons as –1).\n\nMesons are composite particles generally made from a quark and an anti-quark. There are dozens of examples including the pion, kaon, J/Psi, Rho, and D. All mesons are bosons. The quark and anti-quark must have the same color (such as red and anti-red) so that the resulting meson is colorless (or “white”). It is also possible to make mesons out of two (or more) quarks and the same number of anti-quarks, but this kind of particle (a “tetraquark”) is rare, both in nature and in quiz bowl.\n\nFermions are particles with half-integral spin. Spin is a form of “intrinsic angular momentum,” possessed by particles as if they were spinning around their axis (but they aren’t). The values cited for spin are not (usually) the real magnitude of that angular momentum, but the component of the angular momentum along one axis. Quantum mechanics restricts that component to being n/2 times Planck’s constant divided by 2π for some integer n. If n is even, this results in “integral” spin, if it is odd, it results in “half-integral” spin. Note that the exact value of the spin itself is a real number; it’s the multiplier of h/2π that determines whether it is “integral” or not. The most significant thing about fermions is that they are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle: No two fermions can have the same quantum numbers (i.e., same state). The name “fermion” comes from the name of the Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi.\n\nBosons are particles with integral spin. All particles are either bosons or fermions. The spin of a composite particle is determined by the total spin (i.e., the component of its intrinsic angular momentum along one axis) of its particles. For instance, an alpha particle (two protons and two neutrons) has four half-integral spin values. No matter how they are added up, the result will be an integral spin value (try it!), so an alpha particle is a (composite) boson. The Pauli Exclusion Principle does not apply to bosons (in fact, bosons prefer to be in the same quantum state). The name “boson” comes from the name of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose.\n\nHadrons are any particles made out of quarks (alternatively, any particle affected by the strong nuclear force). Generally, this means the baryons and the mesons. All hadrons are colorless (in the sense of the combined color of their constituent quarks). The name “hadron” comes from the Greek for “thick.”\n\nGauge bosons (sometimes called vector bosons) are fundamental bosons that carry the forces of nature. That is, forces result from particles emitting and absorbing gauge bosons. The strong nuclear force is carried by gluons, the weak nuclear force is carried by the W, Z–, and Z+ particles, the electromagnetic force is carried by the photon, and gravity is carried by the (as yet unobserved) graviton. The name comes from the role of “gauge theories” in describing the forces (which are beyond the scope of this article).\n\nGluons are the gauge bosons that carry the strong nuclear force and bind hadrons together. Gluons have no charge and no mass, but do have color (in the sense of quarks). This color cannot be observed directly because the gluons are part of the larger hadron. The name comes from their role in “gluing” quarks together.\n\nPartons are an older name that was used for the “internal parts” of hadrons before the discovery and widespread acceptance of the quark model. Models based on partons are still used but, for the most part, it was determined that partons were quarks and the term is rarely used at the high school level except in historical contexts."

    "title": "Asian Rivers",
    "content": "The Yangtze (or Chang Jiang or Ch’ang Chiang) is the longest river in China and Asia, and the third longest in the world. It rises in the Kunlun Mountains, flows across the Tibetan Plateau, passes the cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai, and empties into the South China Sea. Its basin is China’s granary and is home to nearly a third of Chinese citizens. The river is dammed by the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest, which reduced flooding but displaced 1.5 million people and buried over 1,300 known archaeological sites.\n\nThe Brahmaputra (or Tsangpo or Jamuna) runs 1,800 miles from its source in the Tibetan Himalayas; it starts eastward across the plateau, then turns south into the Indian state of Assam, and then enters Bangladesh, where it merges with the Ganges to form the world’s largest delta. While serving as a historical route to Tibet, the river is also prone to disastrous flooding.\n\nThe Yellow River (or Huang He or Huang Ho) is, at 3,400 miles, China’s second-longest; it is also the most important to the northern half of the country. It rises in Qinghai province and flows into the Bohai Gulf of the Yellow Sea. The river’s name comes from the extraordinary amount of loess silt that it carries, an average of 57 pounds for every cubic yard of water. Among its notable features is the Grand Canal, rebuilt during the Ming Dynasty, that links it to the Yangtze.\n\nThe Ganges (or Ganga) is the holiest river of Hinduism. It rises in the Himalayas and flows a comparatively short 1,560 miles to the world’s largest delta, on the Bay of Bengal. Among that delta’s distributaries are the Hooghly (on whose banks Kolkata — formerly Calcutta — may be found) and the Padma (which enters Bangladesh). Approximately one in every twelve human beings lives in the Ganges Basin, a population density that is rapidly polluting the river; a significant source of that pollution is cremated remains.\n\nThe Mekong is the chief river of Southeast Asia. It originates in eastern Tibet, forms much of the Laos–Thailand border, flows south through Cambodia, and enters the South China Sea in southern Vietnam just south of Ho Chi Minh City. The capital cities Vientiane and Phnom Penh are on the Mekong. The building of dams and clearing of rapids are a source of diplomatic conflict among China, Laos, and Cambodia.\n\nThe Tigris is the eastern of the two rivers that define the historic region Mesopotamia (meaning “the Land Between Two Rivers”), which was home to the ancient civilizations Sumer and Akkad. It rises in Turkey, then flows southeast by Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad before joining the Euphrates to make the Shatt-al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe Euphrates defines the western border of Mesopotamia; it also rises in the Zagros Mountains of Turkey and its shores are home to Fallujah and Babylon. It is the longer of the two rivers, with a course of 1,740 miles (compared to the Tigris’ 1,180). Both the Tigris and the Euphrates have changed courses several times, leaving ruins in the desert where cities have been abandoned.\n\nThe Irrawaddy (or Ayeyarwaddy) is the chief river of Myanmar (also known as Burma). It flows 1,350 miles past Yangon (formerly Rangoon) and Mandalay to the Gulf of Martaban, an arm of the Bay of Bengal. Its delta is one of the world’s most important rice-growing regions, and its name is thought to come from the Sanskrit word for “elephant.”\n\nThe Indus is the chief river of Pakistan and the source of the name of India. It rises in Tibet and flows 1,800 miles to a delta on the Arabian Sea southeast of Karachi. The five major tributaries of the Indus — the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej Rivers — are the source of the name of the Punjab region, which is Persian for “land of the five rivers.” The Indus is the cradle of the Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world’s earliest urban areas, whose main cities were Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa.\n\nThe Jordan River rises in Syria from springs near Mount Hermon. It flows south to Lake Merom, through the Sea of Galilee, and into the Dead Sea, which is 1,300 feet below sea level. The river forms the nation of Jordan’s boundary with the West Bank and northern Israel. In the New Testament, the river was the site of the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist. In modern times, about 80% of its water is diverted for human use, a figure that has led to the shrinking of the Dead Sea and serious contention among bordering nations."

    "title": "Architects",
    "content": "Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959) Born in Wisconsin, Wright worked under Louis Sullivan before founding a Chicago practice. His early homes, like the Robie House — which is adjacent to the campus of the University of Chicago — are in the “Prairie” style: horizontal orientation and low roofs. His “organic architecture” tries to harmonize with its inhabitants and site; examples include the Kaufmann House (also known as Fallingwater) in Pennsylvania; the Johnson Wax Building in Racine, Wisconsin; and Taliesin, his home and studio in Spring Green, Wisconsin. (There is also a Taliesin West, his home and studio in Arizona.) Other notable Wright works are the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, the Larkin Building in Buffalo, the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois, and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, which was one of few buildings to survive a 1923 earthquake (though it has since been demolished).\n\nWalter Gropius (1883–1969) Though Gropius designed the Fagus Factory (Alfeld, Germany) and the Pan American Building (New York City), he is best known for founding the Bauhaus. Beginning in Weimar in 1919 and moving to a Gropius-designed facility in Dessau in 1925, the Bauhaus school emphasized functionalism, the application of modern methods and materials, and the synthesis of technology and art. Its faculty included artists Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, and Josef Albers. Gropius would later head Harvard’s architecture department from 1938 to 1952, shifting its focus to incorporate modern design and construction techniques.\n\nLudwig Mies van der Rohe (1886–1969) The leading architect of the International Style of skyscraper design, Mies (like Walter Gropius) worked in the office of Peter Behrens. He directed the Bauhaus from 1930 to 1933, shutting it down before the Nazis could do so. His works include the Barcelona Pavilion for the 1929 International Exposition; two adjacent apartment buildings at 860 and 880 North Lake Shore Drive in Chicago; the New National Gallery in Berlin; and the Seagram Building in New York, which he co-designed with Philip Johnson. Mies asserted that “less is more” as a principle of his architectural style. His glass-covered steel structures influenced the design of office buildings in nearly every major city in the U.S.\n\nI. M. Pei (1917–2019) Born in China, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1935. Though he has also designed moderate-income housing, Pei is best known for large-scale projects. His works include the Mile High Center in Denver, the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, the John Hancock Building in Boston, the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Fragrant Hill Hotel in Beijing, and the recent Miho Museum of Art in Shiga, Japan. He may be best known for two fairly recent works: the glass pyramid erected outside the Louvre in 1989, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, completed in 1995.\n\nSir Christopher Wren (1632–1723) When fire destroyed much of London in 1666, Wren was an Oxford astronomy professor who had designed his first building just four years earlier. Charles II named him the King’s Surveyor of Works in 1669, and he was involved in rebuilding more than 50 London churches in the next half-century, including Saint Paul’s Cathedral. An inscription near his tomb in Saint Paul’s declares “Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you.”\n\nLe Corbusier (born Charles-Édouard Jeanneret) (1887–1965) Possibly more influential even than Wright, he wrote the 1923 book Towards a New Architecture, standard reading in architectural theory courses. One famous Corbusian quote is “A house is a machine for living in.” His floor plans were influenced by Cubist principles of division of space, and the Villa Savoye (Poissy, France) is his best-known early work. He wrote of the “Radiant City” begun anew, a completely planned city with skyscrapers for residents. Applications of his approach to government buildings (such as in Brasilia or in Chandigarh, India), however, largely failed, as did many urban renewal projects produced on the same ideological foundation. Nonetheless, he influenced every other 20th-century figure on this list.\n\nLouis Sullivan (1856–1924) Sullivan did not design the first skyscraper, but did become a vocal champion of skyscrapers as reflections of the modern age. Though most associated with Chicago, his best-known work is the 1891 Wainwright Building in St. Louis. His partnership with Dankmar Adler produced over 100 buildings. Later works, such as the Babson, Bennett, and Bradley Houses, reflect an organic architecture distinct from that of his onetime employee Frank Lloyd Wright. Sullivan’s dictum that “form should follow function” strongly influenced modern architecture; his writings helped break the profession from classical restraints.\n\nFilippo Brunelleschi broo-nuh-LESS-kee (1377–1446) A friend of Donatello, Brunelleschi was a skilled sculptor and goldsmith, whose 1401 competition with Lorenzo Ghiberti for the commission of the bronze doors of the Florence Baptistery is a frequent question topic (Ghiberti got the chief commission). As an architect, he is mainly known for the extraordinary octagonally-based dome of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore (also known as the Florence Cathedral and often called the Duomo, though that is just the general Italian term for a cathedral), which dominates the Florentine skyline and is across the street from the Florence Baptistery. The task required an innovative supporting framework and occupied much of his career (as described in detail in Giorgio Vasari’s Lives of the Artists). Other projects include the Spedale degli Innocenti (a hospital), the Old Sacristy at San Lorenzo, and the Pazzi Chapel in the Cloisters of Santa Croce, all from 1421 to 1430.\n\nFrank Gehry (1929–present) Winner of the 1989 Pritzker Prize, Gehry is best-known today for large-scale compositions like the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle (formerly known as the EMP Museum and Experience Music Project), the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and the recent, controversial Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. (Bilbao natives describe the latter as “the artichoke,” because of its layers of abstract titanium structures.) Gehry often uses uncommon materials such as plywood and limestone; his designs range from Kobe’s Fishdance Restaurant, shaped like a giant fish, to the soft-sculpture look of the so-called “Fred and Ginger” buildings in Prague. He also designs furniture: the Easy Edges line is made of laminated cardboard; the Gehry Collection consists of chairs named for hockey terms (e.g. Cross Check and Power Play).\n\nAndrea Palladio (1508–1580) Born Andrea di Pietro della Gondola, Palladio designed villas in and near Venice, including the Villa Rotonda and Villa Barbaro. He integrated Greco-Roman ideas of hierarchy, proportion, and order with contemporary Renaissance styles. His Four Books on Architecture from 1570 relates his theoretical principles. Among architects heavily influenced by Palladio were Inigo Jones and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nEero Saarinen (1910–1961) The son of architect Eliel Saarinen, Eero was born in Finland but spent most of his life in the U.S. and died in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He designed many buildings on the campuses of MIT and Yale, as well as Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C. and the TWA terminal at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. Saarinen may be best known for designing the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, though he died before it was completed. Many of his works are characterized by elegant, sweeping forms, such as the Kresge Auditorium at MIT.\n\nAntoni Gaudí (1852–1926) Gaudí created many extraordinary buildings in Barcelona in the early 20th century. His Art Nouveau-inspired works include the Casa Mila and Casa Batllo apartments, known from their undulating façades, and several works for patron Eusebi Guell, including the Parc Guell, a park in Barcelona. He spent 40 years working on the Expiatory Church of the Holy Family (also known as La Sagrada Familia), which will be finished in 2026. He was also fond of using hyperbolic paraboloids in his work."

    "title": "New York Yankees",
    "content": "George Herman “Babe” Ruth (1895–1948; pitcher and outfield), the rough son of a saloon keeper, grew up on the Baltimore waterfront and in the St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys. Released after signing a baseball contract with the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, he was bought by the Boston Red Sox and played with them for six seasons, winning 89 games and three World Series, and, in 1919, setting a new single-season home-run record: 29. Already famous as a player, eater, and carouser, Boston sold him to New York for the 1920 season, where his fame became legend. Moved from the pitcher’s mound to the outfield, he won nine home-run titles and four World Series from 1920 to 1934. In 1927 he hit 60 home runs and led the “Murderers’ Row” Yankee lineup to a sweep of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series. He hit his controversial “Called Shot” homer against the Cubs during the third game of the 1932 World Series after allegedly gesturing towards the centerfield stands. Since his retirement from baseball in 1935, many of his most famous pitching and batting records have been surpassed, but power hitting as a legitimate approach towards playing baseball continues. Before Ruth, the homer was a rare occurrence.\n\nLou Gehrig (1903–1941; first base) was born in Manhattan to German immigrants. A football and baseball player at Columbia University, he signed with the Yankees in 1923. He became a regular in 1925, replacing Wally Pipp at first base and beginning his streak of 2130 consecutive games played (since broken by Cal Ripken Jr. in 1995) that earned him the nickname “The Iron Horse.” His batting feats include 184 RBI in 1931 (the AL record), 23 career grand slams (the ML record for many decades, since broken by Alex Rodriguez), a triple crown in 1934, and a.340 career batting average. When it was discovered that he was suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis—now commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease—he delivered his famous “Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth” speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939. In deference to Lou, no Yankee was appointed captain until Thurman Munson in 1976.\n\nJoe DiMaggio (1914–1999; center field) left the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League and joined New York for the 1936 season, where he helped Lou Gehrig drive the Yankees to their fifth championship and the first of nine that he would win with the Bombers. “The Yankee Clipper” won three Most Valuable Player awards (1939, 1941, 1947), two batting titles (1939, 1940), and two homer titles (1937, 1948). In 1941 “Joltin’ Joe” hit safely in 56 consecutive games, a record that has never been challenged (he once hit in 61 straight for the Seals in 1933). His career totals are abbreviated because of his military service (1943–1945) and because of the distance to Yankee Stadium’s left-field power alley, in those days known as Death Valley. He married Marilyn Monroe in 1954, but they divorced after nine months.\n\nMickey Mantle (1931–1995; center field) was born to play baseball—his father named him for Hall of Fame catcher Mickey Cochrane—but his left leg wasn’t. In high school it was nearly amputated because of osteomyelitis, the first of his many leg problems. Known as the “Commerce Comet” because of his speed and because he grew up in Commerce, Oklahoma, he became the Yankee center fielder following DiMaggio’s retirement in 1951. Mantle played on twelve pennant winners and seven World Championship clubs. He holds World Series records for home runs (18), RBI (40), runs (42), walks (43), extra-base hits (26), and total bases (123). During the regular season, his switch-hitting powered 536 home runs and won him four homer titles (1955, 1956, 1958, 1960), three MVP awards (1956, 1957, 1962), and a triple crown (1956). In 1961 he and teammate Roger Maris both had a chance of passing Ruth’s 1927 mark (60), but injuries forced him out of the race (Maris hit 61). He was elected to the Hall of Fame alongside Whitey Ford in 1974.\n\nYogi Berra (1925–2015; catcher) was notorious for swinging at bad pitches, but his bat collided with them often enough to hit a catcher’s record 306 home runs that lasted for more than 30 years (since passed by Johnny Bench, Carlton Fisk, and Mike Piazza). His hitting, fielding, and ability to lead the Yankee pitching staff earned him three MVP awards (1951, 1954, 1955). He also starred in the World Series, collecting 71 hits while playing on 10 championship teams, both records. Hired as Yankee manager in 1964, he led the Yanks to the pennant but was fired following their Series loss to the Cardinals. His 1973 pennant with the Mets made him the only manager besides Joe McCarthy to take home the flag in both leagues. Like Casey Stengel, he was famous for his quotes, including “It aint’ over ’til it’s over,” “It’s deja vu all over again,” and “Little League baseball is a very good thing because it keeps the parents off the streets.”\n\nCasey Stengel (1889–1975; manager) He managed the Yankees to ten pennants and seven championships, including a record five in a row from 1949 to 1953. The “Old Perfessor” did not use a set lineup or pitching rotation, instead using a bewildering number of platoon arrangements. Somehow this did not undermine his defense, as Stengel’s Yankees led the league in double plays six times. Remembered as a player for his two game-winning home runs, one an inside-the-parker, against the Yankees in the 1923 World Series, off the field his vaudevillian personality involved him in many famous incidents. When in 1958 he was called in front of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly to testify on why baseball should be exempt from antitrust regulation, he testified with an hour’s worth of classic “Stengelese.” When the baffled politicians let Stengel go and called on Mickey Mantle to answer their questions, he replied, “My views are about the same as Casey’s.”\n\nReggie Jackson (1946–present; right field) Known as “Mr. October” because of his World Series slugging, in the sixth game of the 1977 World Series he hit three home runs off three different pitchers on three consecutive swings of his bat. He and Babe Ruth, who did it twice, are the only players to homer three times in one World Series game. His.755 slugging average is the highest in World Series history. Soon after joining the Yankees in 1977 he created a sensation by proclaiming himself “the straw that stirs the drink.” The wild atmosphere surrounding Jackson and the Yankees was captured by a teammate in a book called The Bronx Zoo. Jackson won four home run titles (1973, 1975, 1980, 1983), hit 563 home runs, and set a major-league record for strikeouts (2,597).\n\nDon Mattingly (1961–present; first base) was the best first baseman in baseball for most of the 1980’s. He holds the major league record for most grand slams in a season (6 in 1987, tied by Travis Hafner in 2006). He twice led the league in hits (1984 and 1985), won the league batting title by edging out teammate Dave Winfield on the final day of the 1984 season, and drove in the most runs in 1985 to win the MVP award. “Donnie Baseball” also won nine Gold Gloves, but World Series glory eluded “the Hitman.” His Yankees never played in the Fall Classic. He managed the Dodgers from 2011 to 2015 and has managed the Marlins since 2016.\n\nDerek Jeter (1974–present; shortstop) became the starting shortstop for the Yanks in 1996, winning the Rookie of the Year Award and helping New York capture its first championship since 1978. More post-season highlights followed, including three more titles (1998, 1999, 2000), the 2000 World Series MVP award, and a controversial homer against the Baltimore Orioles in Game One of the 1996 ALCS when a twelve-year-old fan turned his fly ball into a home run by reaching over the right-field wall to catch it. His heroics in the 2001 World Series, which was played later than usual due to 9/11, earned him the nickname “Mr. November.” Jeter holds numerous Yankee records, including the most hits and games played in franchise history. After his jersey number (2) was retired in 2017, the Yankees had retired all single-digit jersey numbers.\n\nAlex Rodriguez (1975–present, shortstop/third base) Nicknamed “A-Rod,” Alex Rodriguez began his career as a phenom shortstop with the Seattle Mariners. After the 2000 season, he signed the largest contract in baseball history and joined the Texas Rangers; he was traded to the Yankees in 2004 and signed an even more lucrative contract extension three years later. He changed positions to third base upon joining the Yankees due to Derek Jeter occupying the former. While A-Rod eclipsed 3,100 hits, hit 696 home runs, and recorded an MLB record 25 grand slams, his later career was marred by issues related to performance-enhancing drugs. Due to his involvement in the Biogenesis scandal, he was suspended for the entire 2014 season. Rodriguez was part of the Yankees’ 2009 World Series-winning team.\n\nAaron Judge (1992–present; right field) Judge took MLB by storm upon his debut in 2017. He homered in his first career at bat, won the year’s Home Run Derby, and finished the season with 52 total home runs, a record for a rookie player. Standing 6 feet, 7 inches tall, Judge instantly became a fan favorite, adopting the nickname “All Rise” and becoming the focus of a small section at Yankee Stadium where fans wear judges’ robes. Judge unusually wears the jersey number 99, which he received in the minor leagues. A free swinger, he also set a record in 2017 by striking out in 37 straight games.\n\nMariano Rivera (1969–present, closing pitcher) Born in Panama, Rivera spent his entire 17-year career with the Yankees, spending much of it as the team’s closer. He primarily made use of a highly effective cutter, a moving fastball that broke an unusual amount of hitters bats. While he was a dominant closer for his entire career, recording a record 652 saves and managing an incredible 2.21 career ERA, he was even more dominant in the playoffs, where his ERA was a mere 0.70. He was the first person to be unanimously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, reaching Cooperstown in 2019. He was also the final player in MLB history to wear the number 42, which was retired league-wide to honor Jackie Robinson; players who wore the number at the time were permitted to continue wearing it, and Rivera was the last such player to retire."

    "content": "Plessy v. Ferguson (Henry B. Brown, Melville Fuller, 7–1, 1896): Homer Plessy (who was legally classified as an “octoroon,” meaning one-eighth black) bought a first-class ticket on the East Louisiana Railway. He sat in the whites-only car in violation of an 1890 Louisiana law mandating separate accommodations. He was convicted, but appealed to the Supreme Court against John Ferguson, a Louisiana judge. The court upheld the law provided that “separate but equal” facilities were provided. John Marshall Harlan issued a famous dissent claiming “Our constitution is color-blind.” Plessy was overturned by Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas.\n\nMarbury v. Madison (John Marshall, 4–0, 1803): On his final day in office in 1801, John Adams signed commissions for 42 federal judges (the so-called “midnight judges”). His successor, Thomas Jefferson, opted to not deliver most of the commissions. One appointee, William Marbury, sued the new secretary of state, James Madison, to force the delivery of his commission. The Judiciary Act of 1789 had granted the court original jurisdiction in such cases, but the Constitution did not. The court ruled that the Judiciary Act conflicted with the Constitution and was therefore void. Therefore Marbury’s request was denied for lack of jurisdiction. This case established the principle of judicial review, the power of the court to nullify unconstitutional laws.\n\nRoe v. Wade (Harry Blackmun, Warren Burger, 7–2, 1973): Norma McCorvey (under the alias Jane Roe), a rape victim, sued Dallas County attorney Henry Wade for the right to an abortion. When the case reached the Supreme Court, the plaintiff depended on the growing recognition of a “right to privacy,” which began with the 1965 case Griswold v. Connecticut. The court struck down state anti-abortion laws as “unconstitutionally vague,” held that the word “person” in the Constitution “does not include the unborn,” and legalized abortion in the first trimester. McCorvey later joined the pro-life movement and claimed that she was not actually raped and that she was pressured into filing the case by her ambitious attorney Sarah Weddington.\n\nBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (Earl Warren, 9–0, 1954): The suit was filed on behalf of Linda Brown, a third grader, who had to walk a mile to a blacks-only school when a whites-only school was much closer. Future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall argued the case for the plaintiff. The court overturned Plessy v. Ferguson and ruled that “separate but equal” facilities were not constitutional. A second case in 1955 required that desegregation proceed “with all deliberate speed” but Southern schools were notoriously slow in complying; it was not until 1970 that a majority had complied with the ruling.\n\nMcCulloch v. Maryland (John Marshall, 9–0, 1819): After the Second Bank of the United States began calling in loans owed by the states, Maryland passed a law taxing out-of-state banks. The federal bank refused to pay, so the state sued its Baltimore cashier, James McCulloch. The court ruled that the federal government had the right to establish the bank even though it was not expressly enumerated in the Constitution and also noted that since “the power to tax was the power to destroy,” Maryland could not tax the bank without destroying federal sovereignty.\n\nBaker v. Carr (William J. Brennan Jr., Earl Warren, 6–2, 1962): Charles W. Baker, a Tennessee citizen, sued the Tennessee secretary of state, Joe Carr, claiming that the state’s electoral districts had been drawn to grossly favor one political party. The defendant argued that reapportionment issues were political, not judicial, matters, but the court disagreed and declared the issue justiciable before remanding the case to a lower court. Two years later, in Reynolds v. Sims, the court mandated the principle of “one man, one vote.”\n\nGideon v. Wainwright (Hugo Black, Earl Warren, 9–0, 1963): Clarence Earl Gideon was accused of breaking into a pool hall in Florida. Because his crime was not capital, the court declined to provide him with an attorney. He was convicted, sued Louie Wainwright — the director of the corrections office — and took his case to the Supreme Court. The court overruled Betts v. Brady and held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments required appointed counsel in all trials. Gideon was retried and found innocent. The case is the subject of the book Gideon’s Trumpet.\n\nHammer v. Dagenhart (William R. Day, Edward Douglass White, 5–4, 1918): The Keating-Owen Act prohibited the interstate sale of goods produced by child labor, leading Roland Dagenhart to sue U.S. attorney W. C. Hammer in Charlotte since his two sons would be put out of work. The court ruled that the federal government did not have the right to regulate child labor; Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a notable dissent focusing on the lack of proper state regulation. The case was overturned by the 1941 case U.S. v. Darby Lumber Company case upholding the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nFletcher v. Peck (John Marshall, 6–0, 1810): In 1795 the Georgia legislature corruptly sold land along the Yazoo River (now in Mississippi) to private citizens in exchange for bribes. The legislators were mostly defeated in the next elections and the incoming politicians voided the sales. In the meantime, John Peck sold some of the land in question to Robert Fletcher, who then sued him, claiming that he did not have clear title. The Supreme Court held that the state legislature did not have the power to repeal the sale. This was one of the earliest cases in which the Supreme Court struck down a state law.\n\nEx Parte Merryman (Roger Taney, 1861): This was not actually a Supreme Court case, but a federal court case heard by Chief Justice Roger Taney while “circuit-riding” when the court was not in session. Lieutenant John Merryman of the Maryland cavalry took an active role in evicting Union soldiers from Maryland following the attack on Fort Sumter. Abraham Lincoln declared a secret suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and had a number of opposition leaders, including Merryman, arrested. Taney found the president had acted unconstitutionally (only Congress can suspend the writ), but Lincoln simply ignored his ruling."

    "title": "20th-century Composers",
    "content": "Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971). He studied under Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and completed two grand ballets for Sergei Diaghilev: The Firebird and Petrushka. His Paris premiere of The Rite of Spring (1913), however, is what inaugurated music’s Modern era. A pagan story featuring polytonal music, The Rite of Spring shocked the audience so much that riots ensued, leading a stunned Stravinsky to pursue rational, \"neoclassical\" music, such as his Symphony of Psalms. In 1940 he moved to Hollywood, where he composed his one full-length opera, The Rake’s Progress, with libretto by W. H. Auden. Late in life, he adopted the serialist, twelve-tone style of Anton Webern, producing the abstract ballet Agon (1957).\n\nArnold Schoenberg (1874–1951). This Austrian pioneered dodecaphony, or the twelve-tone system, which treated all parts of the chromatic scale equally. Schoenberg’s early influences were Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, as evident in his Transfigured Night (1900) for strings. Yet by 1912, with the Sprechstimme (halfway between singing and speaking) piece Pierrot lunaire, he broke from Romanticism and developed expressionist pieces free from key or tone. His students, especially Alban Berg and Anton Webern, further elaborated on his theories. Fleeing Nazi persecution in 1933, he moved from Berlin to Los Angeles, where he completed A Survivor from Warsaw. The first two acts of his unfinished opera, Moses und Aron, are still frequently performed.\n\nBenjamin Britten (1913–1976). Reviver of the opera in the U.K., most notably with Peter Grimes (1945), the story of a fisherman who kills two of his apprentices. Britten broke through with Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937), a tribute to his composition teacher, and wrote incidental music for works by his friend W. H. Auden. With his companion, the tenor Peter Pears, Britten founded the Aldeburgh Festival of Music and wrote operas such as Billy Budd, The Turn of the Screw, and Death in Venice. Britten’s non-operatic works include The Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra (1946) and War Requiem (1961), based on the anti-war poems of Wilfred Owen, who was killed during World War I.\n\nAaron Copland “COPE”-lund (1900–1990). At first a modernist, he was the first American student of Nadia Boulanger in Paris in the 1920s, where he finished his Organ Symphony and Music for the Theater. By the 1930s, Copland turned to simple themes, especially the American West: El Salón Mexico was followed by the ballets Billy the Kid, Rodeo, and Appalachian Spring (1944), the last containing the Shaker hymn “Simple Gifts.” Copland’s Third Symphony contained his Fanfare for the Common Man, while Lincoln Portrait featured spoken portions of Abraham Lincoln’s writings. Copland wrote several educational books, beginning with 1939’s What to Listen For in Music.\n\nSergei Prokofiev (1891–1953). He wrote seven symphonies, of which the First (“Classical,” 1917) is the most notable. While in Chicago, he premiered the opera The Love for Three Oranges, based on Italian commedia dell’arte. Prokofiev moved to Paris in 1922, where he composed works for Sergei Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes, including The Prodigal Son. In 1936 he returned to the USSR, where he completed the popular children’s work Peter and the Wolf and the score for the film Alexander Nevsky. When Stalin denounced Prokofiev as “decadent,” the composer was forced to write obsequious tributes to the premier. Prokofiev survived Stalin, but only by a few hours; both died on March 5, 1953.\n\nDmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975). His work was emblematic of both the Soviet regime and his attempts to survive under its oppression. Shostakovich’s operas, such as The Nose (1928) and Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, were well received at first—until Joseph Stalin severely criticized his work in Pravda in 1936. Fearful for his security, Shostakovich wrote several conciliatory pieces (Fifth, Seventh/Leningrad, and Twelfth Symphonies) in order to get out of trouble. He made enemies, however, with his Thirteenth Symphony (“Babi Yar”). Based on the Yevgeny Yevtushenko poem, Babi Yar condemned anti-Semitism in both Nazi Germany and the USSR.\n\nBéla Bartók (1881–1945). A young girl singing a folk tune to her son in 1904 inspired Bartók to roam the Hungarian countryside with Zoltan Kodály, collecting peasant tunes. This influence permeated his music, including the opera Duke Bluebeard’s Castle (1911) and the ballets The Wooden Prince (1916) and The Miraculous Mandarin (1919). A virtuoso pianist and an innovative composer, Bartók refused to teach composition, contributing to financial problems, especially after he fled Nazi-allied Hungary for the U.S. in 1940. Bartók wrote many prominent instrumental pieces; best known are six string quartets, the educational piano piece Mikrokosmos, and Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta (1936).\n\nCharles Ives (1874–1954). He learned experimentation from his father George, a local Connecticut businessman and bandleader. Ives studied music at Yale but found insurance sales more lucrative; his firm of Ives and Myrick was the largest in New York during the 1910s. Privately, Ives composed great modern works, including the Second Piano (Concord) Sonata (with movements named after Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Louisa May Alcott, and Henry David Thoreau); and Three Places in New England (1914). His Third Symphony won Ives a Pulitzer Prize in 1947, while his song “General William Booth Enters Into Heaven” was based on a Vachel Lindsay poem. Poor health ended both his insurance and music careers by 1930.\n\nMaurice Ravel (1875–1937). His Basque mother gave him an affinity for Spanish themes, as evident in “Rapsodie espagnole” and his most popular piece, “Bolero” (1928). Ravel produced Pavane for a Dead Princess while a student of Gabriel Fauré, but was frustrated when the French Conservatory overlooked him for the Prix de Rome four times. He completed the ballet Daphnis et Chloé (1912) for Sergei Diaghilev, and followed it with Mother Goose and La Valse. He also re-orchestrated Modest Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition. His health declined after a 1932 taxi accident; unsuccessful brain surgery ended his life.\n\nGeorge Gershwin (1898–1937). Known at first for producing popular songs and musicals with his older brother Ira, Gershwin successfully melded jazz and popular music with classical forms, most famously the Rhapsody in Blue (1924), the Concerto in F for Piano and Orchestra (1925), and the folk opera Porgy and Bess (1935), based on a story by DuBose Heyward. Gershwin’s first major hit was 1919’s “Swanee,” sung by Al Jolson, and his 1931 musical Of Thee I Sing was the first musical to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Gershwin died of a brain tumor at age 38.\n\nJohn Cage (1912–1992). An American student of Arnold Schoenberg, Cage took avant-garde to a new level, and may be considered a Dada composer because he believed in aleatory, or “chance” music. His Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (1951) used twelve radios tuned to different stations; the composition depended on what was on the radio at that time. The following year’s 4′33″ required a pianist to sit at the piano for that length of time and then close it; audience noise and silence created the music. Cage also invented the prepared piano, in which screws, wood, rubber bands, and other items are attached to piano strings in order to create a percussion sound.\n\nRalph rayf Vaughan Williams (1872–1958). Best known for reviving the Tudor style and folk traditions in English music, as exemplified in his Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis (1909). Vaughan Williams completed nine symphonies, the foremost his Second (London) in 1914; other principal symphonies included the First (Sea), Third (Pastoral) and Seventh (Sinfonia Antarctica). His orchestral work The Lark Ascending was based on a George Meredith poem, while Sir John in Love (1924) was a Shakespearean opera that featured the “Fantasia on Greensleeves.” Hugh the Drover and The Pilgrim’s Progress are other major Vaughan Williams operas.\n\nSergei Rachmaninoff (1873–1943). A highly skilled pianist and conductor, Rachmaninoff twice turned down conductorship of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He failed to reap the monetary benefits of his early pieces (notably the C-Sharp Minor Prelude of 1892), because he sold them cheaply to a publisher. Treated by hypnosis in 1901, Rachmaninoff began a productive period with his Second Piano Concerto and the symphonic poem The Isle of the Dead (1909). He moved to the U.S. in 1917, after the Bolshevik Revolution. There his output decreased, though he did complete the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini in 1934."

    "title": "Tennis Players",
    "content": "Pete Sampras (1971–present). “Pistol Pete” burst onto the scene in 1990, when he became the youngest man ever to win the U.S. Open. He would take five U.S. Opens and two Australian Opens, but his greatest accomplishments came on the Wimbledon grass. Starting in 1993 he won Wimbledon seven times in eight years, losing only to Richard Krajicek in the quarterfinals in 1996. The last Wimbledon win (2000) gave Sampras the all-time men’s major record, passing Roy Emerson’s 12. Married to actress Bridgette Wilson, Sampras silenced his critics (who thought he was washed up) by defeating Andre Agassi for the 2002 U.S. Open title — then he retired.\n\nBjorn Borg (1956–present). On both grass and clay in the late 1970s, resistance to Borg was futile; he won Wimbledon five straight years (1976–80) and the French Open six times, for a total of 11 majors. Borg got started at age nine, after his father won a tennis racket in a ping-pong tournament and gave it to him. He took his first French in 1974 and dominated through 1981, when John McEnroe finally knocked him off at Wimbledon. Borg then inexplicably retired at 26; he tried an unsuccessful comeback in the early 1990s. Despite his great success, Borg never won the U.S. Open (reaching the final four times). He played at the Australian Open only once, usually preferring to take the winter months off.\n\nAndre Agassi (1970–present). His father boxed for Iran in the 1948 and 1952 Olympics; his own Olympic exploits included the 1996 tennis gold. Born in Las Vegas, he reached the world’s #3 ranking at age 18 but was better known for his image than for his play. Perhaps the greatest returner and baseline player ever, Agassi won his first major on Wimbledon grass in 1992. Briefly married to Brooke Shields, he fell to #141 in the world in 1997, but after they divorced, Agassi rededicated himself to the game. In 1999 he won the French Open, becoming just the fifth man to complete the career Grand Slam. In all, Agassi has won eight major singles titles (five since 1999), and is now married to women’s great Steffi Graf.\n\nJohn McEnroe (1959–present). Though perhaps best known for his fiery temper and abuse of referees (with taunts like “You can’t be serious!”), McEnroe was the dominant player of the early 1980s. As a 17-year old amateur qualifier, he made the semifinals of Wimbledon, and in 1979 he won the first of three straight U.S. Opens. He almost ended Borg’s run of Wimbledons in a five-set thriller in 1980, but succeeded the following year. In 1984, McEnroe compiled an 82–3 record, winning Wimbledon and his fourth U.S. Open, for a total of seven majors. An outstanding doubles player as well, he won 77 titles, many with partner Peter Fleming. He also played in the Davis Cup 12 times, captaining the U.S. team in 2000.\n\nArthur Ashe (1943–1993). Ashe once claimed that he would consider himself a failure if he were remembered only for tennis. The first black man to win either the U.S. Championship (1968) or Wimbledon (1975), he was also the first American tennis player to earn over $100,000 in one year (1970). The author of Hard Road to Glory, a history of black athletes, Ashe announced in 1992 that tainted blood from a 1983 heart surgery had given him the AIDS virus. Arthur Ashe Stadium, the current home of the U.S. Open, was named for him in 1997.\n\nRoger Federer (1981–present) Swiss superstar Roger Federer became the number-one player in the world in February 2004 and held that spot until he was eclipsed by Rafael Nadal in August 2008, a full 237 weeks later. He was 21 when he earned his first of eight Wimbledon championships in 2003, and he stayed dominant for nearly 15 years, earning his 20th major title at the 2018 Australian Open. At the 2008 Olympics, Federer earned a gold medal in men’s doubles with fellow Swiss star Stan Wawrinka. In 2017, he founded the Laver Cup, a team event that pits European players against the rest of the world.\n\nRafael Nadal (1986–present) Like his long-time rival Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal has won a total of 20 majors. Known as the greatest clay court player in history, Nadal earned 13 of his major wins at the French Open at Roland-Garros. He is considered part of the “Big Four“ of 21st-century tennis players (with Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray), and is the only left-handed player among them. Nadal and Andre Agassi are the only two singles players to win each of the four Grand Slam tournaments and an Olympic gold medal, which Nadal won in 2008. Nadal is from Mallorca in the Balearic Islands.\n\nNovak Djokovic (1987–present) The Serbian-born Djokovic has made more money playing than any other player in history, over $145 million. In 2015, he reached the finals of 15 straight tournaments in which he entered, and won three of the four Grand Slam events. After winning the French Open in 2016, Djokovic became the third man ever to hold all four Grand Slam titles at once. At the 2020 U.S. Open, Djokovic was controversially disqualified after a ball he hit accidentally hit a line judge in the throat; he had been the top seed of the tournament and was the first top seed to receive a disqualification at a major event. As of 2020, he is coached by Croatian tennis legend Goran Ivaniševic.\n\nMartina Navratilova (1956–present). Born in Prague, she defected to the United States in 1975 because the Czech Tennis Federation had taken most of her earnings. A bit heavy early in her career, Navratilova won the first two of her nine Wimbledons in 1978–79 but subsequent losses led her to pursue a grueling fitness regimen. This paid off: She won 18 singles Grand Slams (58 overall), 167 total singles titles, and even more doubles crowns, many with partner Pam Shriver. A Wimbledon finalist at 37, Navratilova retired from singles in 1994, but returned to play doubles in 2000. In 2003 she tied Billie Jean King with 20 overall Wimbledons, taking the mixed doubles at age 46.\n\nSteffi Graf (1969–present). Her most devastating shot earned her the moniker “Fraulein Forehand.” Graf turned pro at age 13 and steadily rose through the rankings, garnering the #1 ranking and her first major (French) in 1987. The following year, Graf made history by winning the Grand Slam and the gold medal at the Seoul Olympics, the only player ever to go 5-for-5 in one year. Seven Wimbledons, six French, five U.S., and four Australians add up to 22 major career singles crowns — the last coming at the French in 1999 after two years of major back injuries. Graf retired that fall, and is now raising her son Jaden with her husband Andre Agassi.\n\nChris Evert (1954–present). Queen of the Clay Courts, she won the French Open a record seven times and rolled off a 125-match win streak on the surface. As a 15-year old, Evert upset Margaret Court, who had just won the Grand Slam. 1974 was the first of a record 13 straight years in which she won a major — several of them hard-fought against her rival, Martina Navratilova. In all, Evert took 18 Grand Slam singles titles, and was the first female player to win $1 million in her career. She was married to British tennis player John Lloyd for eight years, but they divorced in 1987, and she then wed Olympic skier Andy Mill.\n\nBillie Jean King (1943–present). Her records themselves are impressive: 12 Grand Slam singles wins (including six Wimbledons) and 20 overall Wimbledon titles. King, however, is best known for advancing women’s athletics. Her brother, Randy Moffitt, pitched for the San Francisco Giants; she herself reached a #4 world ranking in 1960 and turned pro eight years later. At the time, prize money for women was paltry, so she co-founded the Virginia Slims Tour, and in 1971 became the first female athlete to earn $100,000 in a year. Two years later, in front of over 30,000 at the Astrodome, she whipped Bobby Riggs in the “Battle of the Sexes.” King retired in 1983, but not before winning a singles tournament at age 39.\n\nMargaret Smith Court (1942–present). The most prolific winner, male or female, she amassed 62 Grand Slam titles, 24 of them in singles (3 Wimbledon, 5 French, 5 U.S., and 11 in her native Australia). Billie Jean King called Court “The Arm” because of her long reach, aided by her height of nearly six feet. In 1970 she became the second woman (after Maureen Connolly) to win the Grand Slam, taking 21 singles championships overall that year; less impressive was her 1973 loss to 55-year old Bobby Riggs. Court did defeat King, Riggs’s nemesis, 22 of 32 times. She retired in 1977 and became a lay minister.\n\nVenus and Serena Williams (1980–present and 1981–present). Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe may have preceded them as trailblazing African-American players, but the sisters have taken the game to new levels and to more people. Born in Compton, California and coached from an early age by father Richard, Venus broke through first, reaching the final of the U.S. Open in 1997. Serena won a Grand Slam before Venus did (1999 U.S. Open), but Venus hit #1 by sweeping Wimbledon and the U.S. Opens in both 2000 and 2001. For a long time Serena could not beat her older sister, but that changed in 2002, when she took four straight major finals against Venus. With her 2003 win at Wimbledon, Serena now has six majors to Venus’s four. On the side, both are fashion designers, while Venus also designs interiors.\n\nNaomi Osaka (1997–present) Just weeks before turning 21, Osaka bested Serena Williams to win the 2018 U.S. Open. Months later, she won her second major in as many tries at the 2019 Australian Open. Osaka is the first Japanese-born player to win any Grand Slam title. As of 2020, she is the highest-paid female athlete in the world, with annual earnings of over $37 million—the highest single-year total of any female athlete ever, easily beating a record once held by fellow tennis star Maria Sharapova. She has Japanese and Haitian ancestry."

    "title": "Trojan War Heroes",
    "content": "Agamemnon: The king of Mycenae, Agamemnon shares supreme command of the Greek troops with his brother, Menelaus. An epithet of his, “king of heroes,” reflects this status. As a commander, however, he often lacks good public relations skills, as shown by his feud with Achilles (book 1) and by his ill-considered strategy of suggesting that all the troops go home (book 2). Upon his return home, Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus.\n\nMenelaus: The king of Sparta, Menelaus is the husband of Helen, the cause celebre of the war. He tries to win Helen back by fighting Paris in single combat, but Aphrodite carried Paris off when it seemed that Menelaus would win. Despite his notionally equal say in commanding the troops with his brother Agamemnon, in practice Agamemnon often dominates.\n\nAchilles: This “swift-footed” warrior is the greatest on the Greek side. His father is Peleus, a great warrior in his own right, and his mother is Thetis, a sea nymph. The consequences of Achilles’ rage at Agamemnon for confiscating his geras (prize of honor) are the subject of the Iliad. Achilles kills Hector, but is killed by a poisoned arrow in the heel, the only vulnerable place on his body.\n\nPatroclus: Achilles’ foster brother and closest friend. Although Patroclus is a formidable hero, he is valued for his kind and gentle nature. Patroclus is killed by Hector while wearing the armor of Achilles.\n\nAjax the Great: This prince of Salamis is the son of Telamon. He once fights all afternoon in single combat with Hector; since neither one can decisively wound the other, they part as friends. Ajax’s most glorious achievement is fighting the Trojans back from the ships almost singlehandedly. He commits suicide after the armor of Achilles is awarded to Odysseus rather than to himself.\n\nDiomedes: In his day of glory, Diomedes kills Pandarus and wounds Aeneas before taking on the gods. He stabs Aphrodite in the wrist and, with Athena as his charioteer, wounds Ares in the stomach. Along with Odysseus, he also conducts a successful night raid against King Rhesus.\n\nOdysseus: This son of Laertes is known for his cleverness and glib tongue. His accomplishments include a successful night raid against King Rhesus, winning the armor of Achilles, and engineering the famous Trojan Horse. His ten-year trip home to Ithaca (where his wife, Penelope, awaits) is the subject of the Odyssey.\n\nNestor: The king of Pylos, he is too old to participate in the fighting of the Trojan War, but serves as an advisor. He tells tales of “the good old days” to the other heroes.\n\nHector: The son of Priam and Hecuba, he is probably the noblest character on either side. A favorite of Apollo, this captain of the Trojan forces exchanges gifts with Ajax after neither can conquer the other in single combat. He kills Patroclus when Patroclus goes into battle wearing the armor of his friend, Achilles. Killed by Achilles to avenge the death of Patroclus, he is greatly mourned by all of Troy. Funeral games take place in his honor.\n\nParis (sometimes called Alexander): Also the son of Priam and Hecuba, he is destined to be the ruin of his country. He fulfills this destiny by accepting a bribe when asked to judge which of three goddesses is the fairest. When he awards Aphrodite the golden apple, Aphrodite repays him by granting him the most beautiful woman in the world; unfortunately, Helen is already married to Menelaus. Known less for hand-to-hand fighting than for mastery of his bow, he kills Achilles with an arrow but dies by the poisoned arrows of Philoctetes.\n\nPriam: The king of Troy and son of Laomedon, he has 50 sons and 12 daughters with his wife Hecuba (presumably she does not bear them all), plus at least 42 more children with various concubines. Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, kills him in front of his wife and daughters during the siege of Troy.\n\nHecuba (or Hecabe): The wife of Priam, she suffers the loss of most of her children but survives the fall of Troy. She is later turned into a dog.\n\nAndromache: The wife of Hector and mother of Astyanax, she futilely warns Hector about the war, then sees both her husband and son killed by the Greeks. After the war she is made concubine to Neoptolemus, and later marries the Trojan prophet Helenus.\n\nCassandra: This daughter of Priam and Hecuba has an affair with Apollo, who grants her the gift of prophecy. Unable to revoke the gift after they quarrel, Apollo curses her by preventing anyone from believing her predictions. Among her warnings is that the Trojan horse contains Greeks. After Troy falls she is given to Agamemnon, who tactlessly brings her home to his wife Clytemnestra. Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus then kill Agamemnon and Cassandra, leaving Agamemnon’s son Orestes (egged on by his sister Electra) to avenge the deaths and kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus.\n\nLaocoon: Yet another son of Priam and Hecuba, this priest of Apollo shares Cassandra’s doubt about the merits of bringing the Trojan horse into the city. “Timeo danaos et dona ferentes,” he says (according to Vergil), “I fear the Greeks, even bearing gifts.” Later, while sacrificing a bull, two serpents from the sea crush both him and his two young sons. The death of Laocoon is often blamed on Athena (into whose temple the serpent disappeared) but was more likely the act of Poseidon, a fierce Greek partisan.\n\nAeneas: This son of Aphrodite and Anchises often takes a beating but always gets up to rejoin the battle. Knocked unconscious by a large rock thrown by Diomedes, he is evacuated by Aphrodite and Apollo. He succeeds the late Hector as Trojan troop commander and survives the fall of Troy, ultimately settling in Italy. His son Iulus founds Alba Longa, near the site of Rome. That bloodline is the basis of Julius Caesar’s claim to have descended from Venus."

    "content": "Vishnu: One of the Trimurti (the holy trinity of Hindu gods), Vishnu is the Preserver, protecting the world. When needed, Vishnu descends to Earth as an avatar, or incarnation. Nine have appeared so far: Matsya, Kurma (tortoise), Varah (boar), Narasimha (man-lion), Vamana (dwarf), Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, and Buddha. A tenth, Kalki, will appear with a flaming sword to save humans from the darkness. Some cult followers worship Vishnu as Narayana, the primal being. Vishnu has dark blue skin, rides with the eagle Garuda, and sits on the snake Shesha. His symbols are the conch, disc, club, and lotus; his chief wives are Lakshmi and Bhu (the Earth). Kama, the god of love, may be his son.\n\nShiva: Also known as Lord Mahesh, Shiva is the Destroyer in the Trimurti. Developed from Rudra, the Vedic god of death, Shiva is often shown sitting on a tiger skin and riding the bull Nandi. He is also associated with a lingam (phallus). He has three eyes, of which the third (in the middle of his head) is all-knowing; when it opens, the world is destroyed and regenerated. Lord of all underworld beings, he wears a necklace of skulls and another made of a snake. He carries a trident as a weapon and has a blue throat, the result of drinking poison while the ocean churns. Parvati, one of his several consorts, bears him two sons: Kartikeya (the god of war) and Ganesha.\n\nBrahma: The third of the Trimurti, Brahma is the Creator. By dropping an egg into the cosmic waters, he hatches a younger form of Brahma that creates other beings. Also the chief priest, he has four heads that each point in a cardinal direction, representing the Four Vedas. Brahma has a fifth head until Shiva plucked it off; as punishment for that act, Shiva is forced to wander as a beggar and carry Brahma’s severed skull as a bowl. Brahma’s wife is Savitri, who curses him after he lets a cow-maiden stand in for her at an important ritual. Few people worship Brahma, either because of the curse or because he lost a power struggle to Vishnu.\n\nKrishna: This eighth avatar of Vishnu is born when Vishnu plucks two of his own hairs — one light, one dark — and uses the dark hair to impregnate Devaki. Her husband Vasudeva saves Krishna from evil King Kansa by carrying him across the river Yamuna to safety in Gokula. Krishna can be depicted as a child, adolescent, or adult. As an infant, he plays pranks such as stealing butter. As a youthful lover, he plays the flute and dances with the gopis (cow-maidens) in the Vrindavana forest. As an adult, he is a dark-skinned warrior with a light, angelic face, charioteer to Arjuna (in the Mahabharata). In the Bhagavad-Gita it is he who reveals the importance of dharma and bhakti. His consort is the cowherd girl Radha.\n\nGanesha: This elephant-headed god of wisdom and learning is often shown riding a rat. Parvati “gives birth” to Ganesha by creating him from the saffron paste she scrubbed off of herself after bathing. When Parvati instructs Ganesha not to let anyone in as she took another bath, Ganesha prevents Shiva from entering, prompting Shiva to cut off Ganesha’s head. To calm Parvati, Shiva tells servants to take the head of the first baby found whose mother had her back turned; the servants bring back the head of a baby elephant. Ganesha has two wives (Riddhi and Siddhi), two sons, and a daughter. People pray to this remover of obstacles and bringer of good fortune before they commence business.\n\nRama: The seventh avatar of Vishnu is hero of the Ramayana. Born as a prince to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya, Rama wins the hand of his wife Sita in a competition held by Sita’s father, King Janaka; only he can string Shiva’s bow. When his aunt Kaikeyi schemes to deprive him of Dasharatha’s throne by putting her son Bharata there, Rama and Sita are banished to a forest for 14 years. During that time, the ten-headed demon Ravana kidnaps Sita, but Rama rescues her and kills Ravana. Bharata abdicates; Rama makes Sita walk through fire to prove that Ravana had not corrupted her.\n\nIndra: The god of rain, thunder, and war, Indra wields the thunderbolt (vajra) and rides Airavat, the four-tusked white elephant. In early Vedic times he was king of the gods who ruled swarga; many Rig Veda hymns are devoted to him. With the aid of both the Marut storm gods and his favorite drink, soma, Indra leads the Aryan conquest of India. He also defeats the dragon Vritra, who had stolen the world’s water.\n\nLakshmi (or Sri): The last and greatest treasure born from the “churning of the ocean,” Lakshmi is the goddess of prosperity and patron to moneylenders. The epitome of feminine beauty, she sits or stands on a lotus flower and appears in her own avatars alongside Vishnu: Sita to his Rama; Padma the lotus to Vamana the dwarf; Radha (or Rukmini) to Krishna. A form of the mother goddess (Shakti, or Devi), she also represents virtue and honesty.\n\nShiva’s consort: Several incarnations of the “mother goddess” take this moniker. Parvati, the most benevolent form, is the reincarnation of Sati, who threw herself into the fire. Durga is a demon-slayer who rides a lion into battle and carries a weapon in each of her many arms. Kali is a black-skinned goddess of destruction, who defeats the demon leader Raktavija by drinking all of his blood. Although Kali’s dance can destroy the world, Shiva throws himself at her feet to calm her, turning her into Parvati.\n\nArjuna: The chief hero of the Mahabharata, Arjuna is the son of Indra and one of five Pandava brothers, who fight a bitter war against their 100 cousins, Kauravas, culminating at the battle on “Kuru’s Field.” Before the battle, Arjuna asks his charioteer (Krishna) why he must fight. Krishna responds that Arjuna must follow a devotion to god (bhakti), and that even as he slays his brethren, it is for a just cause. Along with the rest of the Pandavas, Arjuna is married to Draupadi.\n\nHanuman: Son of the wind god Vaayu and Queen Anjana, Hanuman has a human body with a monkey’s head. As a boy he swallows the sun (mistaking it for a piece of fruit); the angry Indra whips him with a thunderbolt. In response, the wind god Vaayu refuses to breathe air into the world, prompting Indra to apologize and the other gods to bestow immortality and shapeshifting ability on Hanuman. He figures prominently in the Ramayana, where he flies to Lanka to tell Sita that Rama will rescue her from Ravana.\n\nAgni: Part of a trinity with Surya (the sun) and Vaayu (the wind), Agni can be brought to life by rubbing two sticks together. Since Agni is responsible for sacrificial fires, he is the patron of priests. He has a red body, two heads, three legs, four arms, and seven tongues; he often carries a flaming javelin. In the Mahabharata, Agni’s grandfather is one of seven great sages; with the help of Krishna, he devours the Khandav forest."

    "content": "Pythagorean triples: Sets of small integers that satisfy the equation of the Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2, and could therefore be the side lengths of a right triangle. The simplest ones are {3, 4, 5}, {5, 12, 13}, {7, 24, 25}, and {8, 15, 17}. Note that any multiple of a Pythagorean triple is also a Pythagorean triple, so (for instance) {6, 8, 10}, {15, 20, 25}, and {300, 400, 500} are also ones by virtue of {3, 4, 5} being one.\n\nMatrices: Every team should be able to add, subtract, multiply, take the determinant of, transpose, and invert matrices, particularly 2×2 ones.\n\nVectors: Every team should be able to find the magnitude (length) of a vector, and add, subtract, find the angle between, find the dot product of, and find the cross product of two vectors.\n\nSolids: Teams should be able to calculate the volume and surface area of simple geometric figures including the sphere, cone, cylinder, pyramid, hemisphere, prism, and parallelepiped.\n\nPlane figures: Teams should be able to calculate the areas of triangles, trapezoids, parallelograms, rhombi, regular polygons, and circles using several methods.\n\nSimilar figures: The areas of similar figures are related by the square of any corresponding length, and the volumes are related by the cube of any corresponding length. For instance, if a square has a diagonal that is 30% longer than another square, it has an area that is 1.30 × 1.30 = 1.69 times as great (69% greater). Similar reasoning applies to perimeters, side lengths, diameters, and so forth.\n\nCombinatorics: Teams should be able to compute the number of permutations and combinations of n objects taken m at a time. They should also have memorized the first six (or so) values of the factorial function to make this easier.\n\nLogarithms: Teams should be familiar with basic operations of logarithmic math: simplifying the logarithm of a product, difference, or power, and converting from one base to another.\n\nComplex numbers: Teams should be familiar with the symbol i representing an imaginary square root of –1, basic operations on complex numbers, graphing complex numbers, and converting complex numbers to polar form.\n\nDivisibility rules: Teams should be able to quickly apply the divisibility rules for small integers (2 through 11) to large integers.\n\nPolynomials: Teams should be able to quickly add, subtract, multiply, divide, factor, and find the roots of low-degree polynomials, and understand how the degree behaves under the first four operations.\n\nCalculus: Teams should be able to find the derivative, integral, slope at a point, local extrema, points of inflection, and critical points of polynomial, trigonometric, and other common functions."

    "title": "Civil War Battles",
    "content": "Fort Sumter (April 12, 1861). Built on an island in 1829, the fort was one of three that the United States maintained in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. In order to claim true independence from the Union, Jefferson Davis decided that the forts needed to be taken; a Confederate force under P. G. T. Beauregard ordered the small Union garrison, controlled by Major Robert Anderson, to surrender. Anderson refused, shots were fired, and the Union commander surrendered two days later with only one soldier killed. The Union made two unsuccessful attempts to recapture the fort with ironclad ships in 1863, but Confederate forces finally abandoned Sumter when they left Charleston in February 1865.\n\nFirst Bull Run (or First Manassas) (July 21, 1861). Fought at a creek near Manassas, Virginia (30 miles west of Washington, D.C.), this was the first major showdown of the war. P. G. T. Beauregard led an army against Union commander Irwin McDowell and received reinforcements from Joseph Johnston’s troops (whom Union General Robert Patterson failed to detain). The Confederacy routed the Union when Thomas Jackson’s brigade held the left line at Henry House Hill; this effort earned him the nickname “Stonewall.” Congressmen and reporters, who had expected to watch a Union victory, fled in panic back to D.C.\n\nHampton Roads (March 9, 1862). A channel in southeastern Virginia was the site of the first major fight between two ironclad ships. The Confederates raised an old wooden boat, the Merrimack, and fit it with ten guns and iron armor plates. Renamed the Virginia, it was captained by Franklin Buchanan. The Union countered by constructing a large oval with a rotating gun, called the Monitor and piloted by John Worden. The Virginia tore through Union wooden ships (the Cumberland, Congress, and Minnesota) but when the Monitor arrived, the two ironclads fought to a stalemate; the Union thus maintained its naval blockade of the Confederacy. The South deliberately destroyed the Virginia two months later. The Monitor sank in a storm off Cape Hatteras in December 1862.\n\nShiloh (or Pittsburg Landing) (April 6–7, 1862). This battle was named after a church in Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee (100 miles southwest of Nashville). Confederate commander Albert Sidney Johnston led a force north from Corinth, Mississippi. Ulysses S. Grant, who had just captured Fort Donelson, brought five Union divisions to face him. At first, the South’s surprise attack drove Union troops back, but Grant’s soldiers held the “Hornets’ Nest” for hours, killing Johnston in the process. P. G. T. Beauregard took over, but by the second day Northern Generals Don Carlos Buell and Lew Wallace (who wrote Ben-Hur) brought reinforcements, causing the Confederates to retreat. More than 13,000 Union and 10,000 Confederate soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured at Shiloh.\n\nPeninsular Campaign (March–July 1862). Union commander George McClellan devised this plan to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia by sending 110,000 men up the peninsula between the York and James Rivers. Advised of Northern maneuvers, Southern commander Joseph Johnston detached a force to defend the peninsula. He also sent a small unit (led by Stonewall Jackson) that crushed Union reinforcements in the Shenandoah Valley. After Johnston was wounded at Seven Pines (June 1), Davis replaced him with Robert E. Lee. Lee concentrated his force north of the Chickahominy River; in the Seven Days’ Battles (June 25 – July 1), the Confederates broke through Union defenses, leading to McClellan’s retreat down the James toward Harrison’s Landing, and the failure of the campaign.\n\nSecond Bull Run (or Second Manassas) (August 29–30, 1862). This resounding victory by Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson pushed Union forces back to Washington, D.C. President Abraham Lincoln gathered forces in northern Virginia under General John Pope, who would protect the capital until George McClellan’s Army of the Potomac returned from the Peninsula Campaign. Lee maneuvered Jackson’s troops behind those of Pope; Jackson detained Pope’s men at Manassas while Lee sent James Longstreet to crush Pope’s left flank. Pope’s and McClellan’s joint forces retreated to defend Washington, ceding all of Virginia to the Confederacy and marking a low point in the Union effort.\n\nAntietam (or Sharpsburg) (September 17, 1862). The bloodiest single day of the Civil War: 12,000 Union and 10,000 Confederate casualties. Robert E. Lee invaded Maryland, but a Union soldier discovered Lee’s battle plans wrapped around three discarded cigars. After the Battle of South Mountain (September 14), Lee’s forces retired toward Antietam Creek. Meanwhile, Stonewall Jackson’s forces captured Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, and rushed north to rejoin Lee’s main army. George McClellan had a substantial numerical superiority over Lee’s Confederates, but failed to effectively coordinate his army’s attacks. Antietam thus was actually a series of several distinct clashes, near the Dunker Church, along the Bloody Lane, and around Burnside’s Bridge. After the battle’s conclusion, Lee’s battered army retreated across the Potomac into Virginia; the Union victory allowed President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nFredericksburg (December 13, 1862). At this site, about 50 miles south of Washington, Union commander Ambrose Burnside (who had replaced George McClellan) tried to take the initiative and cross the Rappahannock River in a march toward Richmond. He met Robert E. Lee’s forces, which were well entrenched on Marye’s Heights behind the town. Burnside’s army took heavy losses assaulting the heights, and fell back across the Rappahannock. A later attempt to flank the Confederate position was foiled by heavy rain during the so-called “Mud March” of January 1863.\n\nVicksburg Campaign (April 29 – July 4, 1863). This campaign was launched by Ulysses S. Grant to take control of the Mississippi River and cut off the western Confederate states from the east. Grant ordered forces led by James McPherson, John McClernand, and William Tecumseh Sherman through bayous west of the Mississippi to Hard Times, Louisiana. They were up against Confederate defenders under Joseph Johnston and John Pemberton. Sherman and McPherson drove Johnston from Jackson, Mississippi on May 14, and the Union scored a victory at Champion’s Hill two days later, but could not drive the Southerners out of Vicksburg, so Grant laid siege to the town. Outnumbered 71,000 to 20,000 and on the brink of starvation, Pemberton finally surrendered his men; Johnston withdrew east.\n\nChancellorsville (May 1–4, 1863). A victory for the South, but with great cost, as Stonewall Jackson lost his life. Lincoln called on “Fighting Joe” Hooker to command the Union army; Hooker took a force of 134,000 and provoked Robert E. Lee and Jackson’s 60,000 men into battle. Jackson moved around Hooker and counterattacked the Union flank on May 2. That night, while Jackson was on reconnaissance, his own men mistook him for a Northerner and shot him; he died of pneumonia eight days later. The following morning, a cannonball blast hit the Chancellor House, knocking Hooker unconscious; Union troops, led by John Sedgwick, then retreated. Casualties for the North outnumbered those of the South, 17,000 to 13,000.\n\nGettysburg (July 1–3, 1863). This marked both the farthest northward advance by the Confederacy and the turning point that led to its defeat. Robert E. Lee, along with James Longstreet, A. P. Hill, and Richard Ewell, led the attack into southern Pennsylvania; J. E. B. Stuart was supposed to monitor Union movement with his cavalry, but strayed so far east of Gettysburg that his force did not return (exhausted) until the second day of battle. George Meade replaced Joseph Hooker as leader of the Union army; Southern forces drove Northerners through the town of Gettysburg but could not secure key positions at Cemetery Ridge and Little and Big Round Tops. Low on supplies, on the third and final day Lee ordered an attack on the center; George Pickett led his famous “charge” through open fields, where the Union mowed down one-third of his 15,000 men. The Confederates lost 20,000 and Lee retreated to Virginia.\n\nChattanooga Campaign (September–November 1863). It began when Union General William Rosecrans forced Confederate commander Braxton Bragg out of the city on September 9. Ten days later, at Chickamauga (in Georgia), Bragg and James Longstreet turned the tables by whipping Rosecrans, forcing him into a siege position at Chattanooga. Only George Thomas (the “Rock of Chickamauga”) saved Rosecrans’s army from annihilation. Well-developed railroad networks, however, allowed Ulysses S. Grant, Joseph Hooker, and William Tecumseh Sherman to bring reinforcements. On November 24 Hooker took Lookout Mountain in the southwest, in the “Battle Above the Clouds.” The next day, Thomas ran right over the Southern force at Missionary Ridge, securing Tennessee for the North.\n\nWilderness Campaign (or Overland Campaign) (May 5 – June 12, 1864). The first clash between Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, this series of conflicts started with the Battle of the Wilderness, fought in a dense forest 50 miles northwest of Richmond. At Spotsylvania Court House, George Meade assaulted Robert E. Lee’s men, but Lee’s troops were able to hold on near the “Bloody Angle.” Advancing within ten miles of Richmond, Grant met Lee at Cold Harbor (June 3); he lost 7,000 men to Lee’s 1,500. By the end of the campaign, Grant’s army approached the James River and Lee’s army had suffered severely from a “war of attrition.”\n\nPetersburg Campaign (June 1864 – April 1865). After Cold Harbor, Ulysses S. Grant moved south to lay siege to this railroad hub, 25 miles from Richmond. The trenches in which much of the fighting took place were similar to those later used in World War I. On July 30, Pennsylvania coal miners detonated four tons of powder in a tunnel underneath the Confederate line; this “Battle of the Crater” killed many defenders. Although the South held the city of Petersburg, its supplies ran thin in the winter of 1865. Grant finally destroyed the Confederate right flank at Five Forks (April 1–2), 14 miles southwest of Petersburg. This resounding defeat led to Robert E. Lee’s surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House one week later, effectively ending the Civil War."

    "title": "Olympics (Pre-2000)",
    "content": "1896 Summer (Athens, Greece; April 6 – April 15, 1896): The first edition of the modern Olympics was the brainchild of Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France; winners were awarded silver medals. Some of the stranger events included one-handed weightlifting and 100-meter freestyle swimming for members of the Greek navy. Appropriately, Greek shepherd Spiridon Louis became the hero of the Games by winning the marathon.\n\n1912 Summer (Stockholm, Sweden; May 5 – July 22, 1912): While the Swedes introduced electronic timers to the games, the athletic hero was United States decathlete and Native American Jim Thorpe. He won the pentathlon, placed fourth in the high jump, and seventh in the long jump. Finally, Thorpe went on to win the decathlon with a score so astounding that it would still have won him the silver medal in 1948. During the medal presentation, Swedish king Gustav V said, “Sir, you are the greatest athlete” to which Thorpe purportedly replied “Thanks, King.”\n\n1936 Summer (Berlin, Germany; August 1–16, 1936): These games are best remembered for Alabama native Jesse Owens’ amazing work on the track against a backdrop of Nazi propaganda emphasizing Aryan superiority. The American athlete won the 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash, long jump, and 4×100-meter sprint relay. Despite the growing strength of the Nazi state, the German people became enamored with Owens and named a Berlin street for him after his 1980 death. On other fronts, the Olympics were broadcast on television for the first time (as seen in the film Contact) and also saw the introduction of the relay of the Olympic torch.\n\n1968 Summer (Mexico City, Mexico; October 12–27, 1968): In addition to being the first Olympics to be held at high altitude, these Games saw U.S. long jumper Bob Beamon set a record of 8.90 meters that would remain untouched for 23 years. The Games ended on a controversial note: to protest the Mexican government’s killing of at least 250 unarmed demonstrators on the eve of the Games, Tommie Smith and John Carlos staged a silent protest with a black-gloved, raised-fist “Black Power” salute during the award ceremony for the 200-meter race. This didn’t sit well with the International Olympic Committee, who promptly ordered them home.\n\n1972 Summer (Munich, West Germany; August 26 – September 11, 1972): One of the most tragic Olympics ever, these Games saw the kidnapping and killing of eleven Israeli athletes by eight Palestinian terrorists, five of whom were shot dead by West German police. Jim McKay of ABC Sports remained on the air for hours, bringing American viewers up to date on the situation. Though the Olympics paused for 34 hours, the IOC ordered the games to continue, and memorable performances were turned in by American swimmer Mark Spitz, who won seven gold medals, and Russian gymnast Olga Korbut, who captivated audiences en route to winning three gold medals.\n\n1980 Winter (Lake Placid, New York, United States; February 12–24, 1980): In an Olympics where a single man — American speed skater Eric Heiden — would win five gold medals and not be the biggest story, something very special had to happen. In what would become known as “The Miracle on Ice,” the U.S. Olympic hockey team — led by head coach Herb Brooks and captain Mike Eruzione — defeated the powerful Soviet team 4–3 on February 22, 1980. Two days later, they defeated Finland to claim America’s second Olympic hockey gold medal, the first being in 1960 at Squaw Valley.\n\n1980 Summer (Moscow, Soviet Union; July 19 – August 3, 1980): Despite the glow from the Lake Placid Games, these Games were marred by a United States boycott ordered by President Jimmy Carter in response to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This lead was followed by Canada, West Germany, Japan, Kenya, and China, while other Western nations left it up to their individual athletes, many of whom chose to partake. The result was an Eastern Bloc field day, with all 54 East German rowers earning a medal and the Soviets totaling 80 gold medals. British distance runner Sebastian Coe produced the West’s best performance by winning the 1500-meter race.\n\n1984 Summer (Los Angeles, California, United States; July 28 – August 12, 1984): Virtually every Communist nation skipped these games, leaving the door open for a “USA all the way” feeling, as the Americans took home 83 gold medals out of a total of 174. Among the highlights were American sprinter Carl Lewis’ repeat of Jesse Owens’ 1936 performance: winning the 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash, long jump, and 4×100 meter sprint relay. In gymnastics, West Virginia native Mary Lou Retton won the all-around gold medal.\n\n1994 Winter (Lillehammer, Norway; February 12–27, 1994): Massachusetts native Nancy Kerrigan and Oregonian Tonya Harding were among America’s leading hopes for gold in women’s figure skating. During the Olympic Trials in Detroit, Kerrigan was viciously attacked by an unknown assailant, who would later be traced back to Harding. In the ensuing media circus, both Kerrigan and Harding were sent to Norway, but their thunder was stolen by Ukrainian skater Oksana Baiul, who edged out silver medalist Kerrigan, while Harding placed eighth. Sweden won the ice hockey gold by defeating Canada in a shootout; future Colorado Avalanche forward Peter Forsberg’s game-winning effort against Canadian goalie Sean Burke was immortalized on a Swedish postage stamp. In speed skating, Bonnie Blair won her third straight gold in the 500-meters and second straight in the 1,000-meters, perennial hard-luck kid Dan Jansen won Olympic gold in his last race, the 1,000 meters, and Norwegian Johann Olav Koss won three gold medals, all in world-record times.\n\n1996 Summer (Atlanta, Georgia, United States; July 25 – August 8, 1996): In what have been called “The Coke Games,” due to their exceptional commercialization in the city of Coke’s business headquarters, the sweltering Georgia heat and organizational problems made these Games a veritable nightmare. But a bombing in Centennial Olympic Park that killed one person and injured 100 remains the Games’ most memorable event. The bombing was eventually traced to Eric Rudolph. Irish swimmer Michelle Smith won three gold medals in the pool, only to be plagued by rumors of steroid use. Carl Lewis got his ninth gold by winning the long jump for the fourth consecutive Games, while American sprinter Michael Johnson became the first man to win the 200-meter and 400-meter races, the former in a world-record 19.32 seconds."

    "title": "American Warships",
    "content": "USS Constitution Better known as “Old Ironsides,” the Constitution was one of the first six ships commissioned by the U.S. Navy after the American Revolution. Launched from Boston in 1797, the Constitution first saw action as the squadron flagship in the Quasi-War with France from 1799–1801 and also fought in the Barbary War and the War of 1812. She later served many years as the nation’s flagship in the Mediterranean. Retired from active duty in 1846, the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes’ poem “Old Ironsides” saved her from the scrap yard—she became the training ship of the U.S. Naval Academy until the mid-1880s. She became the symbolic flagship of the U.S. Navy in 1940 and is now a floating museum in Boston.\n\nUSS Chesapeake The USS Chesapeake was built at what is now the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, between 1798 and 1799. The Chesapeake was attacked by the British Leopard off Cape Henry in 1807 (which led to the duel between Commodores James Barron and Stephen Decatur), one of the causes of the War of 1812. She was captured off Boston in 1813 by the British frigate Shannon, on which occasion her commander, Captain James Lawrence, uttered his celebrated dying words, “Don’t give up the ship,” which have become a tradition in the U.S. Navy.\n\nUSS Lawrence and USS Niagara Oliver Hazard Perry’s decisive victory over the British fleet in the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813 ensured American control of the Great Lakes during the War of 1812. In the battle, Perry’s flagship, the USS Lawrence, was severely damaged and four-fifths of her crew killed or wounded. Commodore Perry and a small contingent rowed a half-mile through heavy gunfire to another American ship, the USS Niagara. Boarding and taking command, he brought her into battle and soundly defeated the British fleet. Perry summarized the fight in a now-famous message to General William Henry Harrison: “We have met the enemy and they are ours.”\n\nUSS Monitor and CSS Virginia. (The Virginia was also known as the USS Merrimack.) After departing Union forces burned the Gosport Navy Yard in Norfolk in April 1861, yard workers salvaged the USS Merrimack and converted her into the ironclad CSS Virginia. On March 8, 1862, the CSS Virginia left the shipyard and sank two Union warships in Hampton Roads. The South’s ironclad rammed and sank the USS Cumberland and set fire to and sank the USS Congress. The Monitor was sent to end its rampage and the two ironclads battled for 3½ hours before the Virginia ran aground in its attempt to ram the USS Minnesota. Visibly damaged, the Virginia retreated and the Monitor withdrew to protect the Minnesota. The Confederates destroyed the Virginia soon after to prevent her capture by Union forces. The Monitor, victorious in her first battle, sank in a storm off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The shipwreck is a national underwater sanctuary under the purview of the NOAA.\n\nUSS Maine (ACR–1) [Second class] The first Maine, a second-class armored battleship, was launched in 1889 and in 1897 sailed for Havana to show the flag and protect American citizens. Shortly after 9:40 pm on February 15, 1898, the battleship was torn apart by a tremendous explosion. The court of inquiry convened in March was unable to obtain evidence associating the blast with any person or persons, but public opinion—inflamed by “yellow journalism”—was such that the Maine disaster led to the declaration of war on Spain on April 21, 1898.\n\nUSS Arizona (BB–39) [Pennsylvania class] A lead ship of the honor escort for President Wilson’s trip to France in 1918, she was on Battleship Row at Pearl Harbor when Japanese aircraft appeared just before 8:00 am on Sunday, December 7, 1941. The Arizona came under attack almost immediately, and at about 8:10 was hit by an 800-kilogram bomb just forward of turret two on the starboard side. Within a few seconds the forward powder magazines exploded, killing 1,177 of the crew, and the ship sank to the bottom of the harbor. In 1962 the USS Arizona memorial opened and is now administered by the National Park Service.\n\nUSS Missouri (BB–63) [Iowa class] The fourth USS Missouri was the last battleship completed by the United States; she was laid down January 6, 1941 by New York Naval Shipyard. The Missouri was launched on January 29, 1944 and received her sponsorship from Miss Margaret Truman, daughter of the then-Missouri Senator, Harry S. Truman. Commissioned on June 11, 1944, the “Mighty Mo,” as she became known, sailed for the Pacific and quickly became the flagship of Admiral Halsey, which is why she was chosen as the site of the formal surrender of the Empire of Japan on the morning of September 1, 1945.\n\nUSS Nautilus (SSN–571) [Nautilus class] In 1951 Congress authorized construction of the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine. On December 12 of that year, the Navy Department announced that she would be the sixth ship of the fleet to bear the name Nautilus. She was launched on January 21, 1954. Eight months later, on September 30, 1954, the Nautilus became the first commissioned nuclear-powered ship in the U.S. Navy. On the morning of January 17, 1955, Nautilus’ Commander Wilkinson signaled “Underway on Nuclear Power.” In 1958 she departed Pearl Harbor under top-secret orders to conduct “Operation Sunshine,” the first crossing of the North Pole by a ship."

Eliot’s 1922 masterpiece The Waste Land are “The Burial of the Dead,” “A Game of Chess,” “The Fire Sermon,” “Death By Water,” and “What the Thunder Said.”\n\nMitosis: The five stages of the biological process mitosis (the production of new body cells from existing ones) are interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Interphase is not technically a part of mitosis, though it is often discussed at the same time.\n\nNobel Prize Winners: The five original winners of Nobel Prizes (1901) were Wilhelm Röntgen (physics, for the discovery of X rays), Jacobus Henricus van ’t Hoff (chemistry, for laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure), Emil Adolf von Behring (physiology or medicine, for his serum-therapy remedy for diphtheria), Sully Prudhomme (literature, for his idealistic poetry), and Henri Dunant and Frédéric Passy (peace, for founding the International Red Cross and the first French peace society, respectively).\n\nThe Mighty Handful: Five nationalist Russian composers are often referred to as “The Mighty Handful” or “The Five.” They are Modest Mussorgsky (1839–1881), Mily Balakirev (1837–1910), Alexander Borodin (1833–1887), César Cui (1835–1918), and Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov (1844–1908).\n\nD-Day: The codenames for the five beaches attacked in Operation Overlord on D-Day are Gold, Juno, Sword, Utah, and Omaha. The first three were attacked by British and Canadian forces while the latter two were assaulted by American troops.\n\nOrders of Architecture: There are five classical “orders of architecture,” a term that primarily refers to the design of the columns used in the building. They are the Doric (simple, used for the Parthenon), Ionic (fancier, fluted with scrolls on their capitals), Corinthian (baroque, fluted with acanthus-like leaves for capitals), Tuscan (plain, similar to Doric), and Composite (mixture of Ionic and Corinthian). The first three orders originated with the Greeks; the latter two are Roman developments.\n\nCooperstown: The first five members elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame were Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, and Walter Johnson. They were inducted in 1936.\n\nSpectral Lines: Hydrogen produces an infinite series of spectral lines. The first five of those series are named after scientists who observed them before it was known that they were examples of the same phenomenon. From lowest to highest energy of the final level, they are known as the Lyman, Balmer, Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund series. Only the Balmer series exists in the visible spectrum.\n\nPlatonic Solids: There are only five regular polyhedra (three-dimensional shapes whose faces are all the same regular polygon). They are the tetrahedron (four equilateral triangles), cube (six squares), octahedron (eight equilateral triangles), dodecahedron (twelve regular pentagons), and icosahedron (20 equilateral triangles).\n\nPillars of Islam: Islam has five fundamental tenets of religious life, a group known as the Pillars of Islam. They are the declaration of faith (Shahadah), prayer (Salat), giving charity to those in need (Zakat), fasting during the month Ramadan (Sawm), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj) to be performed once in each adherent’s lifetime."

    "content": "Ymir: A primordial giant who formed in the void Ginnungagap from fire and ice. He gave birth to the frost giants and created the primordial cow Audhumla. He was killed by Odin and his brothers, who used his body to construct most of the universe.\n\nOdin (or Wodin or Wotan): The “All-Father,” he is the leader of the Aesir, the principal group of Norse gods. He is a god of war, death, wisdom, poetry, and knowledge, and rides the eight-legged horse Sleipnir. He hung himself for nine days on the world-tree Yggsdrasil, pierced by his own spear, to gain knowledge, and traded one of his eyes for a drink from Mimir’s well to gain wisdom.\n\nFrigg (or Frigga): The wife of Odin, and mother by him of Balder, Hoder, Hermod, and Tyr. She is the goddess of the sky, marriage, and motherhood, and often works at her loom, spinning clouds.\n\nFrey (or Freyr): The son of Njord, and twin brother of Freya. He is one of the Vanir, a second group of Norse gods, but lives with the Aesir as a hostage. The god of fertility, horses, sun, and rain, his possessions include the magic ship Skidbladnir. He travels in a chariot drawn by the golden boar Gullinbursti, and had to give away his magic sword to win the hand of the giantess Gerda.\n\nFreya: The daughter of Njord and twin sister of Frey, she is also a Vanir hostage living with the Aesir. The goddess of love, passion, and human fertility, her possessions include a cloak that allows her to turn into a falcon, and the necklace Brisingamen. She travels in a chariot drawn by two cats.\n\nThor: A son of Odin and the giantess Jord, he is the god of thunder, weather, and crops. One of the most popular of the Norse gods, he travels in a chariot pulled by two goats, and wields the hammer Mjölnir. He is married to Sif, and his special nemesis is the Midgard Serpent.\n\nLoki: He’s actually giant-kin, but lives with the Aesir and is Odin’s blood-brother. The god of fire and trickery, his many pranks include duping Hoder into killing Balder. His children include the wolf Fenrir, the Midgard Serpent Jormungandr, Hel (the ruler of the underworld), and Sleipnir. After killing Balder he was chained to three boulders with snakes dripping poison onto him.\n\nHeimdall: The son of nine sisters, he is the god of light and guardians. He guards Bifrost, the rainbow bridge into Asgard. His senses are so sharp, he can see 100 miles by night or day and hear grass growing. He will call the Aesir into battle at Ragnarok with his horn Gjall (or Gjallerhorn).\n\nBalder (or Baldur): The fairest of the Aesir, he is the god of light, joy, and beauty. He dreamed of his own death, so Frigga extracted promises from everything not to harm Balder, but she skipped mistletoe. Loki tricked Balder’s blind brother Hoder into killing him with a spear of mistletoe.\n\nNorns: The goddesses of destiny, represented as the three sisters Urd (or Wyrd), Verdandi (or Verthandi), and Skuld. The counterparts of the Greek Fates, they tend the Well of Fate at the roots of Yggdrasil."

    "content": "Revelation: The final book of the New Testament. In particular, it is singular; the plural form will be counted wrong in NAQT competitions. The full name varies from translation to translation, but sometimes appears as “The Revelation of St. John the Divine” or “Apocalypse of John.”\n\nTom Wolfe and Thomas Wolfe: Two different people; Tom Wolfe (1930–2018, in full Thomas Kennerly Wolfe Jr.) is the modern author and journalist who wrote The Right Stuff, The Bonfire of the Vanities, and A Man in Full. Thomas Wolfe (1900–1938, in full Thomas Clayton Wolfe) was an earlier author of works like Look Homeward, Angel and You Can’t Go Home Again. In NAQT competitions, “Thomas Wolfe” will be counted wrong for the former and “Tom Wolfe” as wrong for the latter.\n\nEnharmonic notes: While it is true that on a piano the notes C sharp and D flat are indistinguishable, this is not true on other instruments or under some systems of tuning. Music theory differentiates between notes that are enharmonic in the specific case of the piano; for instance, D flat is a minor second above C natural, while C sharp is an augmented unison above C natural. Enharmonic equivalents may or may not be acceptable depending on the wording of the question.\n\nName order: Hungarian, many East Asian languages (in particular Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean), and some parts of India traditionally place the family name before the given name: for instance, Mishima Yukio’s family name is “Mishima.” Under NAQT rules, all names (regardless of the usual cultural order) may be given in either order: “Mishima Yukio,” “Yukio Mishima,” “Henry James,” and “James, Henry” are all acceptable (if the question is asking for that person), but players should make sure that they know which part of an East Asian name is the family name, as given names will not be accepted and may not even be prompted. Players who are not certain may wish to give both names.\n\nThe Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg: is, despite normal English grammar conventions, the correct title of the short story by Mark Twain. In particular, “The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg” is incorrect.\n\nUnited Kingdom: Since the Act of Union in 1707, England has not existed as a separate political unit, and questions about political entities after that time will nearly always require “United Kingdom” (or “Great Britain”) and will not prompt on “England.” “England” may be acceptable for questions focusing on, for instance, geography or sports.\n\nImmaculate Conception: The Roman Catholic belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was never affected by original sin. In particular, it does not refer to the conception of Jesus.\n\nDaniel Shays: An officer in the Revolutionary War who went on to lead a 1786–1787 rebellion in western Massachusetts opposing high taxes, an episode known as “Shays’ Rebellion.” In particular, his name is not “Shay.” A similar error is often made in giving “van der Waal” as the name of the Dutch chemist whose name is actually “van der Waals.”\n\nPainting titles: From 1300 to 1700, relatively few religious paintings were given specific titles; most have been assigned traditional names based on their subject matter. This means that many titles (e.g., The Descent from the Cross, The Annunciation, The Adoration of the Magi, etc.) occur very frequently, so players should not be too quick to buzz in upon immediately recognizing as a title; in many cases, multiple painters produced works by the same name, so players should pay attention to the descriptions of the works. Similarly, the titles are often not canonical (e.g., El Greco’s Christ Driving the Money-Changers from the Temple may appear as Expulsion from the Temple) and players should keep in mind that the form of the title they know may not be the one given in the question."

    "content": "Gabriel García Marquez (1928–2014, Colombia; Nobel Prize for Literature 1982): The master of magic realism, his birthplace, Aracataca was the model for the fictional town Macondo. The town played a prominent role in many of García Marquez’s works, such as Leaf Storm and his seminal novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), which details the decline of the Buendía family over seven generations. A newspaper journalist in the 1950s, García Marquez exposed a naval scandal (chronicled in The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor). Other prominent novels include In Evil Hour, Love in the Time of Cholera, and The General in His Labyrinth, a depiction of Simón Bolívar’s final years.\n\nPablo Neruda (1904–1973, Chile; Nobel 1971): Born Neftali Reyes, he adopted the surname of the 19th-century Czech poet Jan Neruda. Gabriela Mistral was the head of his school in the small city Temuco. In 1923 his best-known work, Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, was published, which led to diplomatic appointments. As a penniless consul in Burma in the 1930s, he wrote the surrealist collection Residence on Earth. He served in the Chilean senate in the 1940s, though government opponents forced him into exile over his Communist views. Crossing the Andes on horseback inspired his epic Canto general (1950). He died of cancer days after his friend Salvador Allende was deposed.\n\nJorge Luis Borges (1899–1986, Argentina): One-quarter English, Borges learned that language before he learned Spanish. Educated in Europe during World War I, he met a circle of avant-garde poets in Spain, which inspired him to found the ultraismo movement and publish the collection Fervor of Buenos Aires (1923) when he returned to Argentina. While working in a library, Borges developed his greatest short stories, collected in A Universal History of Infamy (1935), Ficciones (1944), and The Aleph (1949). By his fifties, a disorder inherited from his father had taken Borges’s eyesight, but in 1962 he completed the influential story collection Labyrinths.\n\nIsabel Allende (1942–present, Chile): Actually born in Peru, at age three she moved to her mother’s native Chile. A successful news reporter in her twenties, she and her family fled to Venezuela after General Augusto Pinochet deposed her uncle Salvador Allende, setting up a dictatorship. Her formal literary career began at age 40, when she published The House of the Spirits, a magical-realist work that chronicles several generations of the Trueba family. Other works of fiction include the short-story collection Eva Luna (1989) and Paula (1995), which detailed Allende’s care for her terminally ill daughter.\n\nGabriela Mistral (1889–1957, Chile; Nobel 1945): The first Latin American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, Mistral was actually named Lucila Godoy Alcayaga, but took her pen name from the Italian and French poets Gabriele D’Annunzio and Frédéric Mistral respectively. At first a prominent educator, she wrote “Sonnets of Death” (1914) after the suicide of her fiancé. Those sonnets later appeared in her most famous collection, Desolation (1922). A native Chilean, she served as a diplomat both in the United States and Europe. Langston Hughes translated a portion of Mistral’s poetry into English just after she died.\n\nOctavio Paz (1914–1998, Mexico; Nobel 1990): A prominent poet and essayist, Paz supported leftist causes in Mexico; he fought briefly for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. He published the poetry collection Luna silvestre at age 19, and his 584-line poem The Sun Stone deals with the planet Venus, an important symbol to the Aztecs. While studying in Los Angeles, Paz observed flamboyantly-dressed Mexican-American pachucos (“zoot-suiters”), who inspired him to write about Mexico and its Native American/mestizo heritage in his pivotal essay collection The Labyrinth of Solitude (1950). Another prose work, In the Light of India (1997), reflected Paz’s part-(East) Indian heritage.\n\nJosé Martí (1853–1895, Cuba): Best known as a poet and a revolutionary, Martí fought tirelessly for Cuban independence. Imprisoned at age sixteen and exiled from the island several times, he settled in New York for the last fifteen years of his life, where he wrote essays on Walt Whitman, Jesse James, and the threat of Latin American economic dependence on the United States. His Ill-Omened Friendship (1885) is considered the first Spanish modernist novel, and his poetry collections include Our America and Simple Verses, which contains the poem “Guantanamera,” the inspiration for several songs. Martí was killed in a skirmish at Dos Ríos while participating in an invasion with other Cuban exiles.\n\nMario Vargas Llosa (1936–present, Peru): While attending military school in Lima, Vargas Llosa wrote the play The Escape of the Inca (1952), but the harsh treatment he received there was the basis for his novel The Time of the Hero. Conversation in the Cathedral (1969) was Vargas Llosa’s serious take on living under the dictatorship of Manuel Odría, while in 1977 he published the lighter, autobiographical Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, about soap operas. Other important works include The War of the End of the World and A Fish in the Water, which discusses his political career; Vargas Llosa ran for president of Peru in 1990 but was defeated by Alberto Fujimori.\n\nMiguel Asturias (1899–1974, Guatemala; Nobel 1967): Asturias left his native Guatemala in 1923 to study in Paris. There he discovered Mayan mythology, and translated the Popol Vuh into Spanish; the theme would pervade his work, such as 1963’s Mulata de tal. He most famous novel, El señor presidente (1946), was a satire against the oppressive Guatalemalan dictatorship. Asturias also completed a trilogy that blasted exploitation by the American-led United Fruit Company, and the short-story collection Weekend in Guatemala (1956), based on the CIA-led overthrow of president Jacobo Arbenz’s liberal government.\n\nCarlos Fuentes (1928–2012, Mexico): Though born into a well-to-do family, Fuentes often dealt with the betrayed ideals from the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the subject of both his first novel, Where the Air is Clear (1958), and his most successful book, The Death of Artemio Cruz (1962). Other notable novels include Terra nostra, set during the reign of King Philip II of Spain, and The Old Gringo, which portrays Ambrose Bierce’s last days in Mexico. Fuentes also wrote absurdist plays and essay collections on Mexican and American art and literature."

    "title": "Religious Texts",
    "content": "Analects: One of the “Four Books” used by the ancient Chinese for civil service study, it contains the sayings (aphorisms) of Confucius. The philosopher Confucius did not write or edit the words that make up the Analects; his disciples compiled them in the 5th or 4th century BC. Confucianism is more of a philosophical system than a religion, and Confucius thought of himself more as a teacher than as a spiritual leader. The Analects also contain some of the basic ideas found in Confucianism, such as ren (benevolence) and li (proper conduct).\n\nApocrypha: Protestants and Jews assign lower authority to the Apocrypha because it was written between 300 and 100 BC, but Catholics and Orthodox Christians consider the books that make up the Apocrypha to be “deuterocanonical,” meaning that they are just as important and divinely-inspired as other parts of the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible. “Apocryphal” in general means “something outside an accepted canon,” and, in particular, in ancient Greek it meant “hidden things.” Denominations differ as to which books make up the Apocrypha, but Tobit, Judith, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus), and Baruch are almost always included.\n\nAvesta (or Zend-Avesta): Sacred scripture of Zoroastrianism. It consists of five parts: Gathas (poems written by Zoroaster), Visparat (homages to spiritual leaders), Vendidad (legal and medical doctrine), Yashts (hymns to angels and heroes), and Khurda (lesser rituals and hymns). The Gathas may be as old as the 7th century BC, when Zoroaster is thought to have lived, but most of the Avesta was put together by the Sassanid Persian dynasty, between AD 200 and 640. Zoroastrianism centers on the eternal struggle between a good entity (Ahura Mazda, or Ormuzd) and its evil counterpart (Angra Mainyu, or Ahriman); the religion is still practiced by about 120,000 Parsees in Bombay and a few thousand adherents in Iran and Iraq.\n\nBhagavad-Gita: Sanskrit for “The Song of God,” it is a poem found in Book Six of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Likely formalized in the 1st or 2nd century, the Bhagavad-Gita begins on the eve of a battle, when the prince Arjuna asks his charioteer Krishna (an avatar of Vishnu) about responsibility in dealing with the suffering that the impending battle will cause. Krishna tells Arjuna that humans possess a divine self within a material form, and that Arjuna’s duty is to love God and do what is right without thinking of personal gain — some of the main tenets of Hinduism.\n\nTao Te Ching (or The Way and Its Power): Philosophical text behind Daoism, a religion-philosophy founded by the semi-legendary Lao Tzu in the sixth century BC, though scholars now believe it was written about 200 years later, during the Warring States period of the late Zhou dynasty. The Tao Te Ching instructs adherents in restraint and passiveness, allowing the natural order of the universe to take precedent.\n\nHadith: A hadith is a report of the words or actions of a Muslim religious figure, most frequently the prophet Muhammad. Each consists of a matn, or text of the original oral law itself, as well as an isnad, or chain of authorities through which it has been passed by word of mouth through the generations. Collectively, the hadith point Muslims toward the Sunna, or practice of the Prophet, which together with the Qur’an forms the basis for shari’a, usually translated as Islamic law.\n\nBook of Mormon: Published in 1830 by the founder of the Mormon Church, Joseph Smith. Mormons believe that the prophet Moroni revealed the location of the Book of Mormon to Smith, and then Smith translated it from a “reformed Egyptian” language. The Book of Mormon is inscribed on thin gold plates, and documents the history of a group of Hebrews who migrated to America around 600 BC. This group divided into two tribes: the Lamanites (ancestors of American Indians), and the highly civilized Nephites, a chosen people instructed by Jesus but killed by the Lamanites around AD 421.\n\nQur’an (or Koran): Arabic for “recitation,” it is the most sacred scripture of Islam. The Qur’an is subdivided into 114 chapters, called suras, which — except the first one — are arranged in descending order of length. According to Muslim belief, the angel Jibril (Gabriel) visited the prophet Muhammad in AD 610 and revealed the work to him. Various suras discuss absolute submission to Allah (God), happiness in paradise versus torture in hell, and the mercy, compassion, and justice of Allah. The third caliph, Uthman (644–656), formalized the text after many of his oral reciters were killed in battle.\n\nTalmud: Hebrew for “instruction,” the Talmud is a codification of Jewish oral law, based on the Torah. It consists of the Mishnah (the laws themselves), and the Gemara (scholarly commentary on the Mishnah). The Gemara developed in two Judaic centers, Palestine and Babylonia, so there are two Talmuds (Palestinian and Babylonian), the latter considered more authoritative. Rabbis and lay scholars finished the Babylonian Talmud around 600.\n\nUpanishads: Also called Vedanta, or “last part of the Vedas,” the Upanishads were written in Sanskrit between 900 and 500 BC. Part poetry but mainly prose, the earlier Upanishads laid the foundation for the development of several key Hindu ideas, such as connecting the individual soul (atman) with the universal soul (Brahman). Spiritual release, or moksha, could be achieved through meditation and asceticism. The name “Upanishads” means “to sit down close,” as pupils did when a teacher recited them.\n\nVedas: Consist strictly of four hymnbooks: the Rig (prayers in verse), Sama (musical melodies), Yajur (prose prayers), and Atharva (spells and incantations). Each Veda, though, also contains a Brahmana (interpretation), and the Vedas also incorporate treatises on meditation (Aranyakas) as well as the Upanishads. Written in an archaic form of Sanskrit by early Aryan invaders, possibly between 1500 and 1200 BC, the Vedas concentrate on sacrifices to deities, such as Indra (god of thunder), Varuna (cosmic order), and Agni (fire). The major gods Vishnu and Shiva appear as minor deities in the Vedas; their elevation, as well as the concept of karma, does not develop until the Upanishads.\n\nYijing (or I Ching or Book of Changes): The basis for ancient Chinese philosophy and religion, the Yijing was created between 1500 and 1000 BC, though legend has it that the dragon-emperor Fuxi derived its eight trigrams from a turtle shell. The trigrams consist of three either broken (yin) or unbroken (yang) lines, and by reading pairs of these trigrams randomly, one could learn about humans, the universe, and the meaning of life. The Qin emperor Shi Huangdi burned most scholarly books, but the Yijing escaped because it was not seen as threatening."

    "title": "British Monarchs",
    "content": "Alfred the Great (849–899; r. 871–899) Saxon House. Actually just the King of Wessex in southwestern England, he expelled the rival Danes from the Mercian town of London in 886, eventually conquering most of the Danelaw territory. Alfred also kept England from the worst of the Dark Ages by encouraging his bishops to foster literacy; in addition, he translated Boethius, Augustine, and the Venerable Bede’s works into Anglo-Saxon.\n\nWilliam I (the Conqueror) (1028–1087, r. 1066–1087) House of Normandy. Duke of Normandy from 1035, he was promised succession to the throne by Edward the Confessor, but when Edward gave the throne to Harold II in 1066, William invaded England, killing Harold and defeating the Anglo-Saxons at the Battle of Hastings. An able administrator, he authorized a survey of his kingdom in the 1086 Domesday Book. By that time William had replaced Anglo-Saxon nobles and clergy with Normans and other continentals.\n\nHenry II (1133–1189; r. 1154–1189) House of Plantagenet. The son of Geoffrey of Anjou and Matilda, he married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152, and invaded England the following year, forcing Stephen of Blois to acknowledge Henry as his heir. While king he developed the common law and due process, but fought with Thomas à Becket over submission to the Pope; Henry had Becket executed in 1170 but performed penance at Canterbury. Eleanor and his four sons conspired with French king Philip II against Henry on several occasions.\n\nRichard I (the Lion-Hearted) (1157–1199; r. 1189–1199) House of Plantagenet. The third son of Henry II, he spent only five months of his reign in England. He went on the Third Crusade to Jerusalem, winning many victories in the Holy Land, but on his way back was captured by Leopold V, Duke of Austria. He also fought Philip II in Normandy, and died while defending his possessions in Aquitaine.\n\nJohn Lackland (1167–1216, r. 1199–1216) House of Plantagenet. Though he tried to seize the crown from his brother Richard while the latter was in Germany, Richard forgave John and made him his successor. Excommunicated by the Pope for four years for refusing to accept Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury, John was also weak as a fighter, as French King Philip II routed him at Bouvines in 1214. A year later, England’s barons forced John to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede, an event that marked the beginning of the development of the British constitution.\n\nRichard III (1452–1485, r. 1483–1485) House of York. He was made Duke of Gloucester in 1461 when his brother Edward IV deposed the Lancastrian king Henry VI, as part of the Wars of the Roses. Upon Edward’s death in 1483, Richard served as regent to his nephew Edward V, but likely had the boy murdered in the Tower of London that year. Two years later, Richard died at the hands of Henry Tudor’s Lancastrian forces at Bosworth Field, ending the Wars of the Roses and beginning the reign of Henry VII.\n\nHenry VIII (1491–1547, r. 1509–1547) House of Tudor. The son of Tudor founder Henry VII, he brought England into both the Renaissance and the Reformation. Henry patronized the philosopher Erasmus, the painter Hans Holbein the Younger, and the writer Thomas More. Originally a supporter of the Catholic Church — the Pope had named him “Defender of the Faith” — he named himself head of the Church of England in 1533 so that he could divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn. Henry executed top ministers who crossed him, including Thomas Cromwell and Thomas More. He married six times, but only his third wife, Jane Seymour, bore him a son, the sickly Edward VI.\n\nElizabeth I (1533–1603, r. 1558–1603) House of Tudor. Known as the “Virgin Queen” because she never married, as Henry VIII’s daughter by Anne Boleyn, the Catholic Church considered her illegitimate. After the death of her Catholic sister Mary I, Elizabeth I tried to restore religious order by declaring England a Protestant state but naming herself only “Governor” of the Church. She foiled attempts at her throne by Spanish king Philip II and Mary, Queen of Scots; the latter Elizabeth reluctantly executed in 1587. Her reign saw great expansion of the English navy and the emergence of William Shakespeare, but when she died, the Crown went to Scottish king James VI, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nJames I (1566–1625, r. 1603–1625) House of Stuart. At age one James succeeded his mother Mary as King James VI of Scotland. As the great-great-grandson of Henry VII, he claimed the English throne upon the death of Elizabeth I. James was the intended target of Catholic fanatic Guy Fawkes’ failed Gunpowder Plot in 1605. A believer in absolutism, James dissolved Parliament from 1611 to 1621, favoring ministers Robert Cecil and the Duke of Buckingham instead. His rule saw English expansion into North America, through royal charter in Virginia and Puritan protest in Massachusetts.\n\nCharles I (1600–1649, r. 1625–1649) House of Stuart. Charles came into conflict with Parliament almost from the beginning of his reign: when his minister, the Duke of Buckingham, asked for money to fight a costly war against France, Charles was forced to sign the Petition of Right (1628). From 1629 to 1640, Charles tried to rule England without Parliament, a period known as his “Personal Rule” (or, according to his critics, the “Eleven Years’ Tyranny”). Charles’s attempts to impose English forms of church government on Presbyterian Scotland resulted in the Bishops’ Wars (1639–1640), a military humiliation that forced Charles to call the Short Parliament (spring 1640) and Long Parliament (fall of 1640 and after). Charles and the Long Parliament bickered over a variety of issues, including the fate of Charles’s advisor the Earl of Strafford, parliamentarian proposals for reform of the English church, and finally the outbreak of rebellion in Ireland (October 1641). In January 1642 Charles tried to arrest five of his opponents during the sitting of the House of Commons; Parliament demanded control over England’s militia and by August 1642 the country was plunged into civil war. Charles fled (pro-parliamentarian) London, choosing instead to set up his own Cavalier court at the university town of Oxford. Within four years his armies were defeated; from January 1647 Charles was a prisoner of Parliament. In 1648 royalist forces in provincial England rose up in the so-called “Second English Civil War,” which pushed hardliners in Parliament to put the king on trial. Parliament established a “High Court of Justice” to try the king for treason; he was beheaded at Whitehall on January 30, 1649.\n\nCharles II (1630–1685; r. 1660–1685) House of Stuart. While Oliver Cromwell ruled the Commonwealth, Charles was crowned King of Scotland in 1651. After Cromwell died, Charles used the Declaration of Breda to restore himself to the English throne. He fought two lackluster wars against the Dutch, and needed protection from Louis XIV through the Treaty of Dover. His wife Catherine of Braganza produced no legitimate heirs, but this “Merry Monarch” has as many as 14 illegitimate children. Tolerant of Catholics, he dissolved Parliament over the issue in 1681 and refused to prevent his brother James from succeeding him.\n\nJames II (1633–1701; r. 1685–1688) House of Stuart. The 1678 Popish Plot against Charles II would have elevated the Roman Catholic James to the throne, had it been real and not fabricated by Titus Oates. James’s three years, however, did feature heavy favoritism toward Catholics, so much so that Protestants invited James’s son-in-law William of Orange to rule England, deposing James in the Glorious Revolution. Exiled to Louis XIV’s court, he made an attempt to regain his crown in 1690 but was routed at the Battle of the Boyne.\n\nGeorge III (1738–1820, r. 1760–1820) House of Hanover. Though he lost the American colonies in the Revolutionary War, Britain’s economic empire expanded during his reign. While George’s ministers kept their lives, they fell from power frequently, including William Pitt the Elder, Lord Bute, and Lord North. Popular at home, he suffered from porphyria, causing the “madness” that ultimately led to the Regency period (1811–1820) of his son George IV.\n\n(Alexandrina) Victoria (1819–1901, r. 1837–1901; Empress of India 1876–1901) House of Hanover. The second-longest-reigning monarch in British history (after Elizabeth II), she relinquished much of the remaining royal power, both to her husband Albert and to her favored prime ministers, Lord Melbourne, Robert Peel, and Benjamin Disraeli. After Albert’s death in 1861, Victoria largely went into seclusion, though she influenced the passage of the Reform Act of 1867, which doubled the number of Britons who could vote.\n\nElizabeth II (1926–present, r. 1952–present) House of Windsor. Representative of the modern ceremonial monarchy, she and her husband “Prince” Philip Mountbatten have traveled the globe representing British interests. Marital failures by her sons Charles, Prince of Wales and Andrew have plagued her reign. She superseded Victoria as the longest-reigning British monarch."

    "title": "Medieval Islamic Dynasties",
    "content": "Umayyad: The Umayyads ruled as caliphs from Damascus from 661–750. They came to power in the civil war following the death of Uthman when Mu’awiyah Ibn Abu Sufyan defeated the forces of Ali Ibn Abi Talib after the latter’s assassination. Denounced in traditional Islamic historiography for their secular rule, they introduced hereditary transmission of office into Islam and favored Arabs at the expense of other Muslims. Under ’Abd al-Malik, the Umayyad Mosque was constructed in Damascus. In the 10th century, an Umayyad scion re-established the dynasty in Cordoba, Spain.\n\nAbbasid: The Abbasids reigned as caliphs from Baghdad from 750–1258, and later from Cairo from 1261–1517. They rode to power on widespread disaffection with the Umayyads and the sense that a member of the Prophet’s family was best qualified to lead the community. Their greatest rulers were al-Mansur, Harun ar-Rashid, and al-Mamun the Great. During the 9th century, however, power began to devolve onto increasingly autonomous local dynasties, and the Abbasids fell under the control of outside forces such as the Buyids and Seljuqs. When the Mongols destroyed Baghdad in 1258, the caliph as-Mustazim was wrapped in a carpet and trampled to death by horses.\n\nFatimid: The Fatimids were Isma’ili Shi’ite Imams who founded their state in North Africa in 909 under the caliph al-Mahdi. They conquered Egypt in 969 under al-Muizz and built Cairo, becoming the Abbasids’ rivals. At its height their regime reached into Yemen and Syria, and they had a network of missionaries spreading Isma’ili doctrines into Abbasid territory and beyond. In the eleventh century, the caliph al-Hakim — considered insane — disappeared, giving rise to the Druze religion. A later succession dispute gave rise to the sect of the Assassins. The last caliph, al-Adil, died in 1171.\n\nSeljuq: The Seljuqs were a family of Ghuzz Turks who invaded the Middle East in the eleventh century and came to control the Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad. Following their defeat of the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, they settled in Anatolia as well, where they founded the Sultanate of Rum. Following the Central Asian model of “collective sovereignty,” they divided territory among the ruling family, which prevented strong political unity. Their rule saw the beginning of the Sunni revival and the spread of religious schools called madrasas in the Islamic world, giving uniformity to elite beliefs and practices. By 1200 their power was all but extinct.\n\nAyyubid: The Ayyubids were Kurds who took control of Egypt under the Zengids. In 1171 Salah ad-Din (Saladin) abolished the Fatimid caliphate, and later took Damascus as well. He retook Jerusalem from the Crusader kingdoms; however, subsequent Crusades undid some of these gains. It was in Ayyubid times that the Sunni revival came to Egypt. The sultan al-Kamil gave Jerusalem to Frederick II in a peace treaty and was visited by St. Francis of Assisi. The Ayyubids followed the practice of collective sovereignty, and were often politically divided. Shajar ad-Durr, a woman, was the last to rule Egypt.\n\nMamluk: The Mamluks were slave soldiers of foreign origin who deposed the Ayyubids in 1250. Baybars, who turned back the Mongols at the Battle of Ayn Jalut, is a popular figure in Arabic heroic literature. In 1291 they drove the last Crusaders from Palestine. Their reign is divided into a “Bahri” period from 1250–1382 and a “Circassian” period from 1382–1517. They were defeated by the Ottomans, who conquered Egypt in 1517.\n\nOttoman: The Ottomans were Turks of uncertain origin who conquered the Balkans and the Middle East and brought the central Islamic lands into the European state system. Their key military victories were the defeat of the Serbs in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the capture of Constantinople in 1453, and the defeat of the Mamluks in 1517. During the 15th century their lands replaced Palestine as the major target of the Crusades. They reached their height under Suleiman the Magnificient, who beseiged Vienna in 1529. The empire’s remnants became Turkey after World War I.\n\nMughal: The Mughals ruled most of India from the early 16th until the mid-18th century, and claimed descent from both Genghis Khan and Tamerlane. Their empire was founded by Babur and expanded under his grandson Akbar. The Taj Mahal was built under Shah Jahan, who brought the empire to the brink of bankruptcy. Aurangzeb excluded Hindus from public office, and the empire began to break up soon after his death in 1707.\n\nSafavid: The Safavids were founded by a Sunni Sufi (mystic) order under Shah Ismail, and ruled Iran from 1502 until 1736. They forcibly converted Iran to Shi’ism, and later converted themselves (this sounds strange, and is — it’s one of history’s mysteries). They, the Ottomans, and the Mughals comprise the three “Gunpowder Empires” in what scholars of Islamic history consider the late medieval period. Under Abbas I, a European expert was hired to reform the military following defeats by both their Ottoman and Uzbek rivals. Abbas later captured Baghdad and expelled the Portugese from the Persian Gulf. Esfahan was their capital during their height."

    "content": "Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley: Two different people; Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797, married name Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin) is best known as an advocate of educational equality for women, particularly in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). She was the mother of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797–1851) who married the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and is best known as the author of Frankenstein: or, the Modern Prometheus.\n\n“Bloody Mary” and Mary, Queen of Scots: Two different people; “Bloody Mary” is a (pejorative) nickname of Mary I Tudor, the queen of England who preceded Elizabeth I, so named for her persecution of Protestants. Mary, Queen of Scots was Mary Stuart, the queen of Scotland during the first part of Elizabeth’s reign.\n\nThe Merchant of Venice: The title character of The Merchant of Venice is not Shylock — who is a money-lender — but Antonio.\n\nHudson Bay: The large sea of eastern Canada is Hudson Bay (no apostrophe or ‘s’). The company named for it is the Hudson’s Bay Company (possessive). Incorrect forms are not acceptable under NAQT rules.\n\nSaint Augustine: Two different people; the earlier (354–430) served as the Bishop of Hippo and wrote Confessions and City of God The later (?–c. 604) founded the Christian church in southern England and was the first archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nCompound last names: The last names of David Lloyd George, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe are “Lloyd George,” “Lloyd Webber,” “Vaughan Williams,” and “Mies van der Rohe” (or just “Mies”) respectively. Players in NAQT events will be prompted if they give part of a compound last name.\n\n(The) Invisible Man: Invisible Man is a 1952 novel by Ralph Ellison about an unnamed African-American protagonist in search of personal identity. The Invisible Man is an 1897 novel by H. G. Wells about a man who has turned himself invisible but is slowly being driven insane. Under NAQT rules, players are usually allowed to drop leading articles or add them where they are missing (but not use incorrect ones) — but in this case, doing so creates ambiguity, so the title must be exact.\n\nJohn Adams: Even though NAQT rules generally call for players to be prompted on partial names, an answer of “John Adams” will not be prompted if the correct answer is “John Quincy Adams.” An answer of “Adams” will be prompted in either case.\n\n“Concerned” philosophical works: David Hume wrote An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, George Berkeley BARK-lee wrote Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, and John Locke wrote An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. These three philosophical works are often confused.\n\nThe Russian Five: The nationalist composers popularly known as “The Russian Five” or “The Mighty Handful” were César Cui, Aleksandr Borodin, Mily Balakirev, Modest Mussorgsky, and Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov; in particular, they did not include Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes: Two different men; the father, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. (1809–1894), was a physician, poet, and humorist who wrote “Old Ironsides” and The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table. The son, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. (1841–1935), was a justice of the Supreme Court whose decision in Schenk v. U.S. created the “clear and present danger” test."

    "title": "American Plays",
    "content": "Our Town (Thornton Wilder, 1938). A sentimental story that takes place in the village of Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire just after the turn of the 20th century, Our Town is divided into three acts: “Daily Life” (Professor Willard and Editor Webb gossip on the everyday lives of town residents); “Love and Marriage” (Emily Webb and George Gibbs fall in love and marry); and “Death” (Emily dies while giving birth, and her spirit converses about the meaning of life with other dead people in the cemetery). A Stage Manager talks to the audience and serves as a narrator throughout the drama, which is performed on a bare stage.\n\nLong Day’s Journey Into Night (Eugene O’Neill, 1956). O’Neill wrote it fifteen years earlier and presented the manuscript to his third wife with instructions that it not be produced until 25 years after his death. Actually produced three years after he died, it centers on Edmund and the rest of the Tyrone family, but is really an autobiographical account of the dysfunction of O’Neill’s own family, set on one day in August 1912. The father is a miserly actor, while the mother is a morphine addict, and the brother is a drunk; they argue and cut each other down throughout the play.\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Edward Albee, 1962). The author Virginia Woolf has little to do with the story, except that Martha sings the title to George when she is mad at him in Act I. In fact, Albee got the title from graffiti he saw on a men’s room wall. In the drama, George is a professor who married Martha, the college president’s daughter, but the two dislike each other. Martha invites another couple, the instructor Nick and his wife Honey, for drinks after a party for her father. All four of them get drunk, and they end up bickering over their flawed marriages: Besides George and Martha’s problems, Honey is barren, and Nick married her for her money.\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire (Tennessee Williams, 1947). Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski represent Williams’s two visions of the South: declining “old romantic” vs. the harsh modern era. Blanche is a Southern belle who lost the family estate, and is forced to move into her sister Stella’s New Orleans apartment. Stella’s husband Stanley is rough around the edges, but sees through Blanche’s artifice; he ruins Blanche’s chance to marry his friend Mitch by revealing to Mitch that Blanche was a prostitute. Then, after Blanche confronts Stanley, he rapes her, driving her into insanity. The drama was developed into a movie, marking the breakthrough performance of method actor Marlon Brando.\n\nA Raisin in the Sun (Lorraine Hansberry, 1959). Her father’s 1940 court fight against racist housing laws provided the basis for Hansberry’s play about the Younger family, who attempt to move into an all-white Chicago suburb but are confronted by discrimination. The first play by an African-American woman to be performed on Broadway, it also tore down the racial stereotyping found in other works of the time. The title comes from the Langston Hughes poem \"Harlem\" (often called “A Dream Deferred”).\n\nThe Crucible (Arthur Miller, 1953). Miller chose the 1692 Salem witch trials as his setting, but the work is really an allegorical protest against the McCarthy anti-Communist “witch-hunts” of the early 1950s. In the story, Elizabeth Proctor fires the servant Abigail Williams after she finds out Abigail had an affair with her husband. In response, Abigail accuses Elizabeth of witchcraft. She stands trial and is acquitted, but then another girl accuses her husband, John, and as he refuses to turn in others, he is killed, along with the old comic figure, Giles Corey. Also notable: Judge Hathorne is a direct ancestor of the author Nathaniel Hawthorne.\n\nDeath of a Salesman (Arthur Miller, 1949). This play questions American values of success. Willy Loman is a failed salesman whose firm fires him after 34 years. Despite his own failures, he desperately wants his sons Biff and Happy to succeed. Told in a series of flashbacks, the story points to Biff’s moment of hopelessness, when the former high school star catches his father Willy cheating on his mother, Linda. Eventually, Willy can no longer live with his perceived shortcomings, and commits suicide in an attempt to leave Biff with insurance money.\n\nMourning Becomes Electra (Eugene O’Neill, 1931). This play is really a trilogy, consisting of “Homecoming,” “The Hunted,” and “The Haunted.” Though it is set in post-Civil War New England, O’Neill used Aeschylus’s tragedy The Oresteia as the basis for the plot. Lavinia Mannon desires revenge against her mother, Christine, who with the help of her lover Adam Brant has poisoned Lavinia’s father Ezra; Lavinia persuades her brother Orin to kill Brant. A distressed Christine commits suicide, and, after Orin and Lavinia flee to the South Seas, Orin cannot stand the guilt and kills himself as well, leaving Lavinia in the house alone.\n\nThe Glass Menagerie (Tennessee Williams, 1944). Partly based on Williams’ own family, the drama is narrated by Tom Wingfield, who supports his mother Amanda and his crippled sister Laura (who takes refuge from reality in her glass animals). At Amanda’s insistence, Tom brings his friend Jim O’Connor to the house as a “gentleman caller” for Laura. While O’Connor is there, the horn on Laura’s glass unicorn breaks, bringing her into reality, until O’Connor tells the family that he is already engaged. Laura returns to her fantasy world, while Tom abandons the family after fighting with Amanda.\n\nThe Iceman Cometh (Eugene O’Neill, 1939). A portrait of drunkenness and hopeless dreams. Regular patrons of the End of the Line Café anticipate the annual arrival of Theodore “Hickey” Hickman, but in 1912 he returns to them sober. After the patrons reveal their “pipe dreams,” Hickey implores them to give up those dreams and lead productive lives. The “Iceman” is supposed to represent the “death” found in reality.\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof (Tennessee Williams, 1955). Centers on a fight between two sons, Gooper and Brick, over the estate of their father “Big Daddy” Pollitt, who is dying of cancer. After his friend Skipper dies, ex-football star Brick turns to alcohol and will not have sex with his wife Maggie (“the cat”). Yet Maggie announces to Big Daddy that she is pregnant in an attempt to force a reconciliation with—and win the inheritance for—Brick.\n\nThe Little Foxes (Lillian Hellman, 1939). Set on a plantation in 1900, Hellman attempts to show that by this time any notion of antebellum Southern gentility has been destroyed by modern capitalism and industrialism. Three Hubbard siblings (Regina and her two brothers) scheme to earn vast riches at the expense of other family members, such as Regina’s husband Horace and their daughter Alexandra. The title is taken from the Old Testament Song of Solomon: “the little foxes that spoil the vines.”"

    "title": "Russian Tsars",
    "content": "Ivan IV (1530–1584; ruled 1533–1584): Ivan IV is known in the West as “Ivan the Terrible,” but his Russian nickname, Groznyi, would be more accurately translated as “awe-inspiring” or “menacing” (the original meaning of the English word “terrible”). Ivan was proclaimed Grand Prince of Muscovy in 1533 and tsar in 1547. Scholars differ on whether Ivan was literate and on how auspiciously his reign began. Early in his reign, he pushed through a series of well-received reforms and called a zemskii sobor (assembly of the land), but Ivan had an amazingly cruel streak and eventually became unstable: he temporarily abdicated in 1564, killed his favorite son, created a state-within-the-state called the oprichnina to wage war on the boyars, and participated in the torture of his enemies. Ivan combined the absolutist tendencies of his predecessors with his own violent personality, helping to plunge the country into the subsequent period of civil strife known as the “Time of Troubles.”\n\nBoris Godunov (ca. 1551–1605; ruled 1598–1605): Boris Godunov began his career as a boyar in Ivan the Terrible’s oprichnina, and eventually became tsar himself. Boris first cemented his influence by marrying a daughter of one of Ivan’s court favorites and arranging his sister Irina’s marriage to Ivan’s son Fyodor; then he became regent under Fyodor, and was elected tsar when Fyodor died in 1598. But Boris was rumored to have arranged the murder of Fyodor’s brother Dmitrii, and the first of several “False Dmitris” launched a revolt against him. Boris died in the midst of growing unrest and is now best known as the subject of a Pushkin play and a Mussorgsky opera.\n\nMichael (1597–1645; ruled 1613–1645): In 1613, near the end of the Time of Troubles, a zemskii sobor elected the 16-year-old Michael Romanov as the new tsar. Michael was a grandnephew of Ivan the Terrible’s “good” wife Anastasia and the son of a powerful churchman named Filaret (who soon became patriarch); as tsar, he has usually been seen as a nonentity dominated by Filaret and other relatives. Nevertheless, his election marked the return of relative stability and the succession of the Romanov dynasty.\n\nPeter I (1672–1725; ruled 1682–1725): Peter the Great is famous both for his push for Westernization and for his boisterous personality. His Grand Embassy to Europe enabled him to learn about Western life (and even to work in a Dutch shipyard); he later invited Western artisans to come to Russia, required the boyars (aristocrats) to shave their beards and wear Western clothing, and even founded a new capital, St. Petersburg — his “window on the West.” He also led his country in the Great Northern War (in which Charles XII of Sweden was defeated at Poltava), created a Table of Ranks for the nobility, and reformed the bureaucracy and army. But Peter could also be violent and cruel: he personally participated in the torture of the streltsy, or musketeers, who rebelled against him, and had his own son executed.\n\nCatherine II (1729–1796; ruled 1762–1796): Catherine the Great wasn’t really a Russian at all: she was born Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (a minor German principality) and was chosen as the bride of the future Peter III. She had thoroughly Russianized herself by the time Peter became tsar, and soon had him deposed; she then dispatched several claimants to the throne and crushed a peasant uprising led by Emilian Pugachev. She also corresponded with Enlightenment philosophes, granted charters of rights and obligations to the nobility and the towns, oversaw the partition of Poland, and expanded the empire. Catherine is well known for her extravagant love life: her 21 acknowledged lovers included Grigorii Potemkin (who constructed the famous Potemkin village on an imperial inspection tour).\n\nAlexander I (1777–1825; ruled 1801–1825): Alexander I took the throne in 1801 when his repressive father Paul was assassinated and immediately set out on a more liberal course, but he left his strongest supporters disappointed. He is best known for his wars with Napoleon (first as an ally and then as an enemy), and for seeking to establish a Holy Alliance in the years that followed. Alexander was an eccentric and a religious mystic. Some even say that he didn’t really die in 1825: instead, they argue, he faked his own death, became a hermit, and died in a monastery in 1864.\n\nNicholas I (1796–1855; ruled 1825–1855): Nicholas I, who ruled Russia from the failure of the Decembrist Uprising to the middle of the Crimean War, has traditionally been portrayed as the embodiment of the Russian autocracy. His government pursued a policy of Official Nationality, defending a holy trinity of “Autocracy, Orthodoxy, and Nationality,” and established a repressive secret police force known as the Third Section. Contemporaries referred to him as the “Gendarme of Europe” after he helped the Habsburgs squelch the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.\n\nAlexander II (1818–1881; ruled 1855–1881): Alexander II embarked on a program of Great Reforms soon after taking the throne near the end of the Crimean War. The most famous part of his program was the serf emancipation of 1861 — a reform which occurred almost simultaneously with the end of American slavery (and whose gradual nature disappointed liberals), But he also introduced a system of local governing bodies called zemstvos, tried to increase the rule of law in the court system, eased censorship, and reorganized the army. Alexander became more reactionary after an attempted assassination in 1866, and was successfully assassinated in 1881.\n\nAlexander III (1845–1894; ruled 1881–1894): Those who hoped that the assassination of Alexander II would lead to liberalization saw the error of their ways when the new tsar, Alexander III, launched his program of “counter-reforms.” Under him, the state enacted a series of Temporary Regulations (giving it the power to crack down on terrorism), increased censorship, tightened controls on Russia’s universities, created a position of “land captain” to exert state control in the countryside, and either encouraged or ignored the first anti-Jewish pogroms.\n\nNicholas II (1868–1918; ruled 1894–1917): Nicholas II, the last of the Romanovs, ruled until his overthrow in the February Revolution of 1917. He is usually seen as both a kind man who loved his family and an incapable monarch who helped bring about the end of the tsarist state; he led his country through two disastrous wars, the Russo-Japanese War (which helped spark the Revolution of 1905), and World War I (which helped cause the 1917 revolutions), He is best known for his loving marriage to Alexandra and for allowing the “mad monk” Grigori Rasputin to influence court politics while treating the hemophilia of Alexei, the heir to the throne. Nicholas abdicated in 1917 and was shot in 1918."

    "title": "20th-century Paintings",
    "content": "Guernica, by Pablo Picasso. Guernica was a Basque town bombed by the Germans during the Spanish Civil War in April 1937. Picasso had already been commissioned to paint a mural for the Spanish Pavilion at the World’s Fair, and he completed his massive, black, white, and grey anti-war mural by early June 1937. Picasso’s Cubist approach to portraying the figures adds to the sense of destruction and chaos. Guernica was in the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York until 1981, when it was returned to the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Spain.\n\nNude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, by Marcel Duchamp. Nude Descending a Staircase was painted in 1912 and created a sensation when shown at the 1913 Armory Show in New York, where one critic referred to it as “an explosion in a shingle factory.” Painted in various shades of brown, Nude Descending a Staircase portrays a nude person in a series of broken planes, capturing motion down several steps in a single image. The painting reflects a Cubist sense of division of space, and its portrait of motion echoes the work of the Futurists.\n\nThe Persistence of Memory, by Salvador Dalí. First shown in 1931, The Persistence of Memory is probably the most famous surrealist painting. The landscape of the scene echoes the area around Portlligat, Dalí’s home. The ants, flies, clocks, and the Portlligat landscape are motifs in many other Dalí paintings, and the trompe l’oeil depiction of figures is typical of his works. It currently belongs to the MOMA; its 1951 companion piece, The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory, hangs at the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nLes Demoiselles d’Avignon, by Pablo Picasso. This painting depicts five women in a brothel. However, the images of the women are partly broken into disjointed, angular facets. The degree of broken-ness is rather mild compared to later Cubist works, but it was revolutionary in 1907. The rather phallic fruit arrangement in the foreground reflects the influence of Paul Cézanne’s “flattening of the canvas.” The two central figures face the viewer, while the other three have primitive masks as faces, reflecting another of Picasso’s influences. It is currently housed at the MOMA.\n\nBroadway Boogie Woogie, by Piet Mondrian. While Les Demoiselles d’Avignon and other Cubist paintings represent an extension of Paul Cézanne’s division-of-space approach to the canvas, Mondrian’s De Stijl works are a still further abstraction, such that the canvas is often divided up into rectangular “tile patterns,” as in Composition with Red Blue and Yellow. The painting simultaneously echoes the bright lights of a marquee, resembles a pattern of streets as seen from above, and creates a feeling of vitality and vibrancy, not unlike the music itself. This work can also be found at the MOMA.\n\nCampbell’s Soup Can, by Andy Warhol. Pop Art parodies (or perhaps reflects) a world in which celebrities, brand names, and media images have replaced the sacred; Warhol’s series of Campbell’s Soup paintings may be the best illustration of this. Like the object itself, the paintings were often done by the mass-produceable form of serigraphy (silk screening). Also like the subject, the Warhol soup can painting existed in many varieties, with different types of soup or numbers of cans; painting 32 or 100 or 200 identical cans further emphasized the aspect of mass production in the work. The same approach underlies Warhol’s familiar series of prints of Marilyn Monroe, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and other pop culture figures.\n\nNighthawks, by Edward Hopper. As is often the case with his works, Hopper uses a realistic approach (including such details as the fluorescent light of the diner, the coffee pots, and the Phillies cigar sign atop the diner) to convey a sense of a loneliness and isolation, even going so far as to depict the corner store without a door connecting to the larger world. Hopper’s wife Jo served as the model for the woman at the bar. Nighthawks is housed at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nI and the Village, by Marc Chagall. Painted in 1911, I and the Village is among Chagall’s earliest surviving paintings. It is a dreamlike scene that includes many motifs common to Chagall, notably the lamb and peasant life. In addition to the two giant faces—a green face on the right and a lamb’s head on the left—other images include a milkmaid, a reaper, an upside-down peasant woman, a church, and a series of houses, some of them upside-down. I and the Village is currently housed at MOMA.\n\nChristina’s World, by Andrew Wyeth. The Christina of the title is Christina Olson, who lived near the Wyeths’ summer home in Cushing, Maine. In the 1948 painting, Christina lays in the cornfield wearing a pink dress, facing away from the viewer, her body partly twisted and hair blowing slightly in the wind. In the far distance is a three-story farmhouse with dual chimneys and two dormers, along with two sheds to its right. A distant barn is near the top middle of the painting. One notable aspect is the subtle pattern of sunlight, which strikes the farmhouse obliquely from the right, shines in the wheel tracks in the upper right, and casts very realistic-looking shadows on Christina’s dress. The Olson house was the subject of many Andrew Wyeth paintings for 30 years, and it was named to the National Register of Historic Places for its place in Christina’s World.\n\nAmerican Gothic, by Grant Wood. Wood painted his most famous work after a visit to Eldon, Iowa, when he saw a Carpenter Gothic-style house with a distinctive Gothic window in its gable. Upon returning to his studio, he used his sister Nan and his dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby, as the models for the two figures. The pitchfork and the clothing were more typical of 19th-century farmers than contemporary ones. American Gothic is among the most familiar regionalist paintings, and it is said to be the most parodied of all paintings. It hangs at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it was submitted for a competition by Wood upon its completion in 1930 (Wood won a bronze medal and a $300 prize)."

    "content": "Tiger Woods (1975–present) Born to an African-American father and a Thai mother, he appeared on The Mike Douglas Show with a golf club at age two. Woods won three straight U.S. Junior Amateurs, and then became the only golfer to win three straight U.S. Amateurs (1994–1996). In 1997 Woods became the youngest ever to win the Masters—by a whopping 12 strokes. At the 2000 U.S. Open, when he won by 15 strokes, Woods began a remarkable run of four straight major championships: British Open (by eight strokes, making him the youngest ever to complete the career Grand Slam), PGA Championship, and the 2001 Masters. He accumulated 14 major wins by 2008, when his career was derailed by injuries and personal issues, including infidelities leading to a highly publicized separation from his former wife. His long-awaited comeback reached its peak in 2019 when he won the Masters, his 15th major title.\n\nJack Nicklaus (1940–present) Nicknamed “The Golden Bear,” he won the U.S. Amateur twice (1959 and 1961), and was the 1961 NCAA champion at Ohio State. He took his first major the following year at the U.S. Open, beating Arnold Palmer on Palmer’s home course. Nicklaus became the youngest Masters champion at the time in 1963, and 23 years later became the oldest champion with a final round 65 in 1986. He has a record 18 major pro championships overall, including six Masters, five PGA Championships, four U.S. Opens, and three British Opens. Nicklaus is still somewhat active on the Senior PGA Tour, and as a golf course architect.\n\nArnold Palmer (1929–2016) A native of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Palmer made golf popular with the masses, as his fans were known as “Arnie’s Army.” He won seven majors, including four Masters, and was the first golfer to earn one million dollars on the PGA Tour. Later Palmer became one of the stars of the Senior Tour, winning the Senior PGA Open in 1980 and 1981. In 2002 he played in his last competitive Masters.\n\nBen Hogan (1912–1997) The PGA Tour’s leading money winner from 1940–1942 and in 1946 and 1948, two events interrupted his playing career: service in World War II and a near-fatal 1949 head-on car accident. After each, though, Hogan rose to the top of his game; he won nine majors overall (six after the accident), including four U.S. Opens. In 1953 he accomplished a feat matched only by Tiger Woods: winning three modern major championships in one season (the Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open).\n\nRobert Tyre “Bobby” Jones (1902–1971) An Atlanta native, and the greatest amateur golfer of all time, Jones never turned pro, but won thirteen major championships in eight years, including four U.S. Amateurs. In 1930 he won what was then considered the Grand Slam, taking both the British and U.S. Amateur and Open Championships. After that season, Jones retired from golf to practice law, but helped design a golf course in Augusta, Georgia that became the permanent site of the Masters in 1934.\n\nSam Snead (1912–2002) No golfer has won more PGA Tournaments than Snead’s 81, and he amassed 135 victories worldwide. Nicknamed “Slammin’ Sammy,” he won seven major professional championships between 1942 and 1954, but he is known more for the one he never won: the U.S. Open. In 1939 Snead led the Open for 71 holes but lost on the last hole when he took an eight. In the 1960s and ’70s he won a record six Senior PGA Championships.\n\nTom Watson (1949–present) He became the major rival to Jack Nicklaus in the second half of the Golden Bear’s career. Watson’s greatest achievements were at the British Open, a tournament he won five times between 1975 and 1983. He took eight major championships overall.\n\nLee Trevino (1939–present) Nicknamed “Supermex” for his Mexican-American heritage, Trevino came from a poor Dallas family and served in the Marines, but came from nowhere to win the 1968 U.S. Open. He won six majors: the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the PGA Championship twice each, his second PGA in 1984 at age 44. That last win was most impressive because it came after the 1975 Western Open, where Trevino was struck by lightning on the golf course.\n\nGary Player (1935–present) The most successful non-American golfer in history, this South African has won nine majors. When Player took his only U.S. Open crown in 1965, he not only became the first non-American to win that tournament in 45 years, but he also became one of three (now five) golfers (along with Nicklaus, Woods, Hogan, and Gene Sarazen) to win all four modern Grand Slam events. Nicknames include “The Black Knight” for his dress and “Mr. Fitness” for his devotion to exercise.\n\nPhil Mickelson (1970–present) Known as “Lefty” due to his swing (though he is naturally right-handed), Phil Mickelson won The Masters in 2004, 2006, and 2010, and has also won a PGA Championship and British Open. Though he has never reached number 1 in the World Golf Ranking, Mickelson was a constant force during the 2000s, finishing second in the U.S. Open six times. In 2018, Mickelson won “The Match,” a pay-per-view event against Tiger Woods using the match play format; the win earned Mickelson $9 million.\n\nRory McIlroy (1989–present) McIlroy won his first major championship at the U.S. Open in 2011, and despite being just 22 years old, he finished at 16 strokes under par, a record for the tournament. He won three more majors in the following three years, and became the top-ranked golfer in the world in 2012; after doing so, he and Luke Donald took turns at the top spot for over a year. He briefly regained the top ranking in 2020, a year in which he and Dustin Johnson raised over £1.5 million for coronavirus relief in a televised skins game. Though he is from Northern Ireland, McIlroy has expressed interest in competing for Ireland in international competition instead of the U.K.\n\nJordan Spieth (1993–present) In 2015, the year he turned 22, Spieth won both the Masters and the U.S. Open, and finished second at the PGA Championship. His Masters win was the first in which the same golfer lead after all four days since Raymond Floyd did it in 1976, and it included an 8-under-par opening day and a record-tying 18-under-par result for the tournament. Spieth has struggled more in recent years, failing to win any PGA Tour events since his British Open win in July 2017."

    "title": "Psychologists",
    "content": "Sigmund Freud (Austrian, 1856–1939): Sigmund Freud founded the extremely influential discipline psychoanalysis, which used the free-association technique to identify fears and repressed memories. He argued that many problems were caused by mental states rather than by biochemical dysfunction — a purely materialist viewpoint then in vogue. He separated the psyche into the id (illogical passion), ego (rational thought), and superego (moral and social conscience). His best-known works are The Interpretation of Dreams and The Psychopathology of Everyday Life.\n\nCarl Jung (Swiss, 1875–1961): Carl Jung was a close associate of Freud’s who split with him over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis. He went on to create the analytic psychology movement and introduced the controversial notion of the collective unconscious — a socially shared area of the mind. Quiz bowlers should be familiar with anima, animus, introversion, extroversion, and archetypes, all terms that occur frequently in questions on Jung. (Of course, being familiar with them entails knowing what specifically they mean, and how they relate to Jung’s work.)\n\nAlfred Adler (Austrian, 1870–1937): Alfred Adler was another close associate of Freud who split with him over Freud’s insistence that sexual issues were at the root of neuroses and most psychological problems. Adler argued in The Neurotic Constitution that neuroses resulted from people’s inability to achieve self-realization; in failing to achieve this sense of completeness, they developed “inferiority complexes” that inhibited their relations with successful people and dominated their relations with fellow unsuccessful people, a theory given the general name “individual psychology.”\n\nIvan Pavlov (Russian 1849–1936): Ivan Pavlov was more of a physiologist than a psychologist, but questions about him are more often classified as psychology than biology by question writers. He is largely remembered for his idea of the conditioned reflex, for example, the salivation of a dog at the sound of the bell that presages dinner, even though the bell itself is inedible and has no intrinsic connection with food. He won the Nobel Prize in 1904 for Physiology or Medicine for unrelated work on digestive secretions.\n\nJohn B. Watson (American, 1878–1958): John Watson was the first prominent exponent of behaviorism; he codified its tenets in Behavior: An Introduction to Comparative Psychology, arguing that psychology could be completely grounded in objective measurements of events and physical human reactions. His most famous experiment involved conditioning an eleven-month-old boy to be apprehensive of all furry objects by striking a loud bell whenever a furry object was placed in his lap.\n\nB. F. Skinner (American, 1904–1990): B. F. Skinner was one of the leading proponents of behaviorism in works like Walden II and Beyond Freedom and Dignity. He argued that all human actions could be understood in terms of physical stimuli and learned responses, and that there was no need to study — or even believe in — internal mental states or motivations; in fact, doing so could be harmful. Guided by his ideas, he trained animals to perform complicated tasks, including teaching pigeons to play table tennis.\n\nJean Piaget (Swiss, 1896–1980): Jean Piaget is generally considered the greatest figure of 20th-century developmental psychology; he was the first to perform rigorous studies of the way in which children learn and come to understand and respond to the world around them. He is most famous for his theory of four stages of development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. His most famous works are The Language and Thought of a Child and The Origins of Intelligence in Children.\n\nErik Erikson (German-born American, 1902–1994): Erik Erikson is best known for his theories on how social institutions reflect the universal features of psychosocial development; in particular, how different societies create different traditions and ideas to accommodate the same biological needs. He created a notable eight-stage development process and wrote several “psychohistories” explaining how people like Martin Luther and Mahatma Gandhi were able to think and act the way they did.\n\nAbraham Maslow (American, 1908–1970): Abraham Maslow is principally known for two works, Motivation and Personality and Toward a Psychology of Being, that introduced his theory of the hierarchy of needs (food, shelter, love, esteem, etc.) and its pinnacle, the need for self-actualization. Self-actualized people are those who understand their individual needs and abilities and who have families, friends, and colleagues that support them and allow them to accomplish things on which they place value. The lowest unmet need on the hierarchy tends to dominate conscious thought.\n\nStanley Milgram (American, 1933–1984): Though he did the work that created the idea of “six degrees of separation” and the “lost-letter” technique, he is mainly remembered for his experiments on obedience to authority that he performed at Yale in 1961–1962. Milgram found that two thirds of his subjects were willing to administer terrible electric shocks to innocent, protesting human beings simply because a researcher told them the experimental protocol demanded it."

    "title": "Japanese Authors",
    "content": "Lady Murasaki Shikibu (c. 978 –c. 1015): Novelist, diarist, and lady-in-waiting. She was the author of the Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari), the first known novel; the diary Murasaki Shikibu nikki; and a collection of tanka poems. The daughter of the court official Fujiwara Tametoki, she sat in on the classical Chinese literature lessons that her brother received, in spite of the Heian traditions against higher education for women.\n\nSei Shonagon (c. 966 – c. 1013): Like Lady Murasaki, Sei Shonagan was a lady-in-waiting of the Empress. Since Lady Murasaki and Sei Shonagan were contemporaries and known for their wit, they were often rivals*. Sei Shonagan’s only major work is the Pillow Book (Makura no soshi), which is considered the best source of information about life at the Japanese court during the Heian period (784–1185).\n\nZeami (1363–1443), also called Kanze Motokiyo: The second master of the Kanze theatrical school, which had been founded by his father, he is regarded as the greatest playwright of the No theater. He provided 30 to 40 of the approximately 230 plays in the modern repertoire. He revised the works of his father Kan’ami, such as Wind in the Pines, and wrote a number of his own dramas, including the samurai play Atsumori. Also a drama critic, he established the aesthetic standards by which plays have been judged ever since. His Fushi kaden (The Transmission of the Flower of Acting Style) is a manual for his pupils.\n\nMatsuo Basho (1644–1694), a pseudonym of Matsuo Munefusa: Generally acknowledged as the master of the haiku form, the most notable influences on his work were Zen Buddhism and his travels throughout Japan. He is noted for works like The Narrow Road to the Deep North (Oku no hosomichi), which includes descriptions of local sights in both prose and haiku. He took his pseudonym from the name of the simple hut where he retired: Basho-an, which means “Cottage of the Plaintain Tree.”\n\nChikamatsu Monzaemon (1653–1725): He was one of Japan’s first professional dramatists (as opposed to playwright-actors). Originally named Sugimori Nobumori, Chikamatsu wrote more than 150 plays for both the bunraku (puppet theater) and the kabuki (popular theater). Chikamatsu’s scripts fall into two categories: historical romances (jidaimono) and domestic tragedies (sewamono). One of Chikamatsu’s most popular plays was The Battles of Coxinga, an historical melodrama about an attempt to re-establish the Ming dynasty in China. He is also largely responsible for developing the sewamono (contemporary drama on contemporary themes) in the joruri, a style of chanted narration adapted to bunraku.\n\nAkutagawa Ryunosuke (1892–1927): His mother died insane while he was a child, and his father was a failure who gave him up to relatives. Despite this inauspicious childhood, his 1915 short story “Rashomon” brought him into the highest literary circles and started him writing the macabre stories for which he is known. In 1927 he committed suicide by overdosing on pills, and his suicide letter “A Note to a Certain Old Friend” became a published work. “Rashomon” also was key to his international fame, as in 1951 Kurosawa Akira made a film entitled Rashomon, though the film’s plot is more based on Akutagawa’s other short story “In a Grove.” One of Japan’s two most prestigious literary prizes is named for Akutagawa; it is awarded for the best serious work of fiction by a new Japanese writer.\n\nKawabata Yasunari (1899–1972): Recipient of the 1968 Nobel Prize for Literature, he was the first Japanese author to win the Nobel. His works combine classic Japanese values with modern trends, and often center on the role of sex in people’s lives. Many of his short stories are only a few pages long, a form given the name “palm-of-the-hand.” He is best known for three novels: Thousand Cranes, based on the tea ceremony and inspired by The Tale of Genji; The Sound of the Mountain, about the relationship of an old man and his daughter-in-law; and Snow Country, about an aging geisha. A friend of Mishima Yukio, he was also associated with right-wing causes and openly protested the Cultural Revolution in China. He committed suicide two years after Mishima.\n\nMishima Yukio (1925–1970), a pseudonym of Hiraoka Kimitake: He was a novelist whose central theme was the disparity between traditional Japanese values and the spiritual emptiness of modern life. He failed to qualify for military service during World War II, so worked in an aircraft factory instead. Mishima’s first novel, Confessions of a Mask (Kamen no kokuhaku), was successful enough to allow him to write full-time. His four-volume epic The Sea of Fertility (Hojo no umi, consisting of Spring Snow, Runaway Horses, The Temple of Dawn, and The Decay of the Angel), is about self-destructive personalities and the transformation of Japan into a modern, but sterile, society. Mishima, who organized the Tate no kai — a right-wing society stressing physical fitness and the martial arts — committed ritual suicide after a public speech failed to galvanize the armed forces into overthrowing the government.\n\nEndo Shusaku (1923–1996): He converted to Catholicism at the age of 11, and majored in French literature. His first works, White Man and Yellow Man, explored the differences between Japanese and Western values and national experiences. Silence tells of the martyrdom of the Catholic converts of Portuguese priests. The Samurai recounts the tale of a samurai sent to establish trade relations between his shogun and Mexico, Spain, and Rome. The latter two novels are generally considered to be Shusaku’s greatest achievements.\n\nOe Kenzaburo (1935–present): Novelist and recipient of the 1994 Nobel Prize for Literature. His first work, Shiiku (The Catch), describes a friendship between a Japanese boy and a black American POW, and won him the Akutagawa award while he was still a student. His early works are filled with insanity, abuse, perverse sex, and violence, but his later works — including A Personal Matter (Kojinteki-na taiken) and The Silent Cry (Man’en gannen no futtoboru) — reflect the experience of being the father of a brain-damaged child. His fiction centers on the alienation following Japan’s surrender, and his political writings focus on the search for cultural and ideological roots."

    "title": "Elections",
    "content": "1800: Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson narrowly beat the incumbent Federalist John Adams 73–65, marking the ascent of that party’s power. At the time, all electoral votes were cast in the presidential race rather than having a separate ballot for the vice presidency. Thus both Jefferson and Democratic-Republican VP candidate Aaron Burr had 73 electoral votes, and Burr refused to step aside. In the House of Representatives, neither man won the necessary nine state delegations outright until the 36th ballot, when James Bayard of Delaware cast a blank vote, turning the election in Jefferson’s favor. The debacle led to the ratification of the 12th amendment in 1804. The Federalists never recovered; Alexander Hamilton’s opposition to Adams led to a permanent split between the two, and Hamilton’s opposition to Burr was one cause of their 1804 duel, in which Burr (then the vice president) killed Hamilton. This was the first peaceful transfer of power from one party to another.\n\n1824: The candidates were John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, William Crawford, and Andrew Jackson, all Democratic-Republicans. After John C. Calhoun decided to seek the vice presidency and Crawford (from Georgia) had a stroke, Jackson took most of the South and won the popular vote. Jackson had 99 electoral votes, Adams 84, Crawford 41, and Clay 37, but since none had more than 50% of the vote, the House decided the election. Adams won in the House with support from Clay, and Jacksonians cried foul when Clay was made Secretary of State (the so-called “corrupt bargain”), giving fuel to Jackson’s victorious 1828 campaign. Jackson is the only candidate to lose a presidential race despite having the most electoral votes, and he is one of five (with Tilden, Cleveland, Gore, and Hillary Clinton) to lose despite winning the popular vote. The election also led to the founding of the Democratic Party.\n\n1860: Another four-candidate election, with Republican Abraham Lincoln, (northern) Democrat Stephen Douglas, (southern) Democrat John C. Breckinridge, and Constitutional Unionist John G. Bell. The Republican Party, founded in 1854, won in its second election (its first candidate being John C. Frémont in 1856), aided by the fragmenting of the Democrats. Bell took Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia, Breckinridge swept the other slave states, and Lincoln nearly swept the free states. Though winning under 40% of the total popular vote, Lincoln dominated the electoral count with 180 to a combined 123 for his opponents (Breckinridge 72, Bell 39, Douglas 12). Seven southern states seceded before Lincoln even took office, and war soon followed.\n\n1876: Republican Rutherford B. Hayes faced Democrat Samuel Tilden, best known for battling Tammany Hall and the Tweed Ring in New York. Tilden won the popular vote and seemed to win the election, but results in Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana were contested, as was one vote in Oregon; if Hayes swept these votes, he would win the electoral count 185–184. In Congress, an informal bargain was reached (often called the Compromise of 1877) in which Hayes won the election in exchange for Reconstruction being brought to an end.\n\n1896: In the election itself, Republican William McKinley swept the North and Northeast to beat Democrat William Jennings Bryan, but the campaign was the interesting part. The most prominent issue, the gold standard versus free silver coinage, led to Bryan’s famous “Cross of Gold” speech. Shunned by the Eastern press, Bryan — a legendary orator — traveled 18,000 miles through 27 states and was heard by some three million people. McKinley would not accept Bryan’s challenge to debate, comparing it to putting up a trapeze and competing with a professional athlete. McKinley instead had a “front porch” campaign, as railroads brought voters by the thousands to hear him speak in his hometown, Canton, Ohio. Mark Hanna, McKinley’s campaign manager, is often considered the first modern campaign manager. The election also represented the demise of the Populist Party and ushered in a 16-year period of Republican rule. The gold question would disappear soon after the election with gold strikes in Australia and Alaska.\n\n1912: Three presidents — Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson — earned electoral votes. Roosevelt, displeased with his successor Taft, returned to lead the progressive Republican faction; after Taft got the Republican nomination, Roosevelt was nominated by the Progressive Party (nicknamed the “Bull Moose” Party). Wilson won with 435 electoral votes to Roosevelt’s 88 and Taft’s 8, making Taft the only incumbent to finish third in a re-election bid. Though Wilson did set forth his New Freedom program, his dominating win must be credited largely to the splitting of the Republican vote by Roosevelt and Taft.\n\n1948: In the most recent election with four significant candidates, Democrat Harry Truman beat Republican Thomas Dewey, contrary to the famous headline of the Chicago Tribune, which was printed before results from the West came in. Dewey dominated the northeast, but Truman nearly swept the West to pull out the victory. Former vice president Henry Wallace earned over a million votes as the Progressive candidate, and Strom Thurmond took over a million popular votes and 39 electoral votes as the States’ Rights (or Dixiecrat) candidate.\n\n1960: John F. Kennedy defeated vice president Richard Nixon 303–219 in a tight election, winning the popular vote by just two-tenths of a percent. The first Kennedy-Nixon debate (September 26, 1960) is a classic in political science; those who saw the calm, handsome Kennedy and the tired, uncomfortable-looking Nixon on television were more likely to select Kennedy as the winner than were those who listened on radio. (Theodore White’s notable The Making of the President series began with the 1960 election.) Voting irregularities in Texas and Illinois (especially in Richard Daley’s Chicago) led to allegations of fraud, but a recount would not have been feasible, and Nixon did not press the issue. Nixon would go on to lose the 1962 California gubernatorial race (occasioning his famous statement “You won’t have Dick Nixon to kick around any more”).\n\n1968: After Lyndon Johnson declined to run for re-election, and after Robert F. Kennedy was killed in California, the Democratic nomination went to Hubert Humphrey. Richard Nixon, gradually returning from political obscurity over the past six years, gained the Republican nomination. Alabama governor George Wallace ran as the American Independent candidate, becoming the last third-party candidate to win multiple electoral votes. Nixon edged Humphrey by half a million popular votes and a 301—191 electoral count, while Wallace won nearly ten million votes. Wallace’s presence may well have tipped the election to the Republicans, who, after being out of power for 28 of the last 36 years, would hold the presidency for all but four years through 1992.\n\n2000: The closest election in American history. Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote to George W. Bush by a final count of 271—266 (one Gore elector abstained). Ralph Nader of the Green Party won an important 2.7% of the vote, while Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party placed fourth. New Mexico and Oregon were initially too close to call but went to Gore, and Florida became the center of attention. Ballot confusion in Palm Beach County, intimidation of vote recounters in Miami-Dade County, and absentee ballots throughout Florida became significant issues, as Americans had to hear about butterfly ballots, hanging chads, and Florida Secretary of State Katharine Harris for the next five weeks. Gore officially conceded the election on December 13, 2000."

    "title": "Egyptian Deities",
    "content": "The family quarrel of Osiris and Set: Osiris took Isis, his sister, for his wife, and ruled over the earth. Set grew jealous of his brother and killed him, afterwards cutting his body into 14 pieces and hiding them in various places around Egypt. He then claimed kingship over the land. Isis searched the breadth of the land until she had recovered all of the pieces and, with the help of Anubis, embalmed the body. She conceived a son, Horus, by the (still dead) Osiris, then resurrected him. Horus defeated Set to regain the kingship, and all subsequent pharaohs were said to be aspects of him.\n\nAfterlife: The Egyptians believed that the soul had three primary components, the ba, ka, and akh, each of which had different roles after death. The ka remained near or within the body (which is why mummification was required). The ba went to the underworld where it merged with aspects of Osiris, but was allowed to periodically return (which is why Egyptian tombs often contained narrow doors). The akh could temporarily assume different physical forms and wander the world as a ghost of sorts. In the underworld, the ba was subjected to the Judgment of Osiris in the Hall of Double Justice, where the heart of the deceased was weighed against Ma’at, commonly represented as an ostrich feather.\n\nWorship of Aton: This is actually a historical episode: during the reign of Amenhotep III (1390–1353 BC), worship of the god Aton (or Aten) — a representation of the disk of the sun — was resurrected. This process was carried to its extreme conclusion by his successor, Amenhotep IV, who eventually declared Aton to be the only god, thereby creating one of the earliest known monotheistic religions. The pharaoh even changed his name to Akhenaton, meaning “Aton is satisfied.” The worship of Aton was centered on the capital city Tell-al-Amarna, and was largely confined to upper classes and the pharaonic court; it did not survive Amenhotep. Under his successor, Tutankhamen (King Tut), traditional religious practices were restored.\n\nOsiris: Husband of Isis, father of Horus, and brother of Set, Osiris served as god of the underworld and protector of the dead. In addition to his role as the chief and judge of the underworld (as a result of the above-mentioned murder by Set), Osiris also served as a god of vegetation and renewal; festivals honoring his death occurred around the time of the Nile flood’s retreat. Statues representing him were made of clay and grain, which would then germinate. Osiris was represented either as a green mummy, or wearing the Atef, a plumed crown.\n\nSet: Created in opposition to the forces of Ma’at, Set (termed Typhon by Plutarch) fought the demon Apopis each day, emerging victorious, symbolic of the struggle of forces that brought harmony. In later times, this struggle led Set to be associated with the serpent itself, and Set became the personification of violence and disorder, and the cause of all disasters. Having killed his brother Osiris, Set did battle with Osiris’ son Horus, being emasculated in the fight. His cult was diminished over time, due to reaction against violence, and many of his effigies were destroyed.\n\nIsis: Isis, daughter of Geb and Nut, protected love, motherhood, and fate in the Egyptian mythos. Many of her roles are similar to those of the goddess Hathor, but she is often equated with the Greek Demeter. Her powers were gained through tricking the god Ra. By placing a snake in his path, which poisoned him, she forced him to give some power to her before she would cure him.\n\nHorus: The god of the sky and light and the son of Isis and Osiris. In some myths, he was the brother of Set, and son of Ra. His mother impregnated herself by the dead Osiris, then hid Horus. When he was grown, he avenged his father’s death, driving away Set. In the battle, he lost his eye, but regained it thanks to the god Thoth. Thus Horus came to rule over the earth. He was known to have two faces, that of the falcon and that of a child, Harpocrates.\n\nRa: Personification of the midday sun, he was also venerated as Atum (setting sun) and Khepri (rising sun), which were later combined with him. He traveled across the sky each day and then each night, the monster Apep would attempt to prevent his return. Other myths held that Ra spent the night in the underworld consoling the dead. Ra was the god of the pharaohs, so from the fourth dynasty onward all pharaohs termed themselves “sons of Ra,” and after death they joined his entourage. He was portrayed with the head of a falcon, and crowned with the sun disk.\n\nAmon: Amon began as a local god of Thebes, governing the air, fertility, and reproduction. His wife was Mut, and his son was Khon. Later, Amon became linked with the sun god Ra, and the two combined as Amon-Ra. In this form, he became worshipped beyond Egypt, and identified with Zeus and Jupiter. His appearance in art was as a man in a loincloth, with a headdress topped by feathers, but other appearances show him with the head of a ram. The temple of Amon-Ra at Karnak was the largest ever built.\n\nThoth: Serving the gods as the supreme scribe, the ibis-headed Thoth was known as the “tongue of Ptah” for his knowledge of hieroglyphics, and as the “Heart of Re” for his creative powers. His knowledge of science and calculation made him the creator of the calendar, and his symbol was the moon due to his knowledge of how to calculate its path. His knowledge of magic led to his association with the Greek Hermes. Thoth was consulted by Isis when attempting to resurrect Osiris, and was again consulted when the young Horus was stung by a scorpion.\n\nPtah: Principal god of the city of Memphis, he was portrayed as a mummy, or wearing the beard of the gods on his chin. His godhood was achieved by himself, much like his creation power, done merely by act of will. A patron of craftsmen, he also was seen as a healer, in the form of a dwarf. He was seen as the god of embalming. His wife was the cat-headed Sekhmet, and his son was the lotus god Nefertem.\n\nAnubis: Son of Osiris and Nepthys, and god of embalming to the Egyptians, he was typically pictured with the head of a jackal. He also served as the god of the desert and the watcher of the tombs. He also served to introduce the dead to the afterlife, and as their judge. To decide the fate of the dead, Anubis would weigh the heart of the dead against the feather of truth. Anubis is sometimes identified with Hermes or Mercury.\n\nMa’at: The daughter of Ra, she predated the universe and served over the creation of it, ensuring balance between everything. Primarily seen as the keeper of order, Ma’at was responsible for seasons, day and night, rainfall, and star movements. A symbolic offering of Ma’at, in the form a statuette was given to the gods, as Ma’at encompassed all other offerings. Ma’at’s aspect as god of justice also showed through her role in death ritual, where her ostrich feather was weighed against the hearts of the dead in the underworld. Judges wore effigies of Ma’at, and the supreme head of courts was said to be the priest of Ma’at.\n\nHathor: Hathor (or Athor or Athyr) was the patron of women. Hathor was the daughter of Ra and the wife of Horus. She fulfilled many functions as goddess of the sky, goddess of fertility, protector of marriage, and goddess of love and beauty. In that final role she became equated with Aphrodite and Venus. Pictures of Hathor often show the goddess with the head of a cow.\n\nNephthys: Termed the “lady of the castle,” for her role as guardian of tombs, she sided against her own husband, Set, in his battle against Osiris, but when Set was destroyed, she collected the bits of his body and brought him back to life, much as Isis had done for Osiris. In addition to being Isis’ sister, she was also said to be Osiris’ mistress, leading to much complaint from Isis. Due to her close ties to all the other gods, she was rarely associated with a cult of her own."

    "content": "Wayne Gretzky (1961–present): Born in Brantford, Ontario, “The Great One” was named Canada’s athlete of the century. Gretzky holds or shares 61 NHL records, including career goals (894), assists (1,963), and points (2,857). The winner of ten scoring titles (Art Ross Trophies) and nine NHL MVP’s (Hart Trophies), his #99 was retired league-wide. He won four Stanley Cups with Edmonton in the 1980s before a major trade sent him to Los Angeles in 1988. After a brief stint in St. Louis, he finished his career with the New York Rangers in 1999.\n\nGordie Howe (1926–2016): Born in Floral, Saskatchewan, “Mr. Hockey,” was equally adept with his stick as he was with his fists. A “Gordie Howe hat trick” was later joked to consist of a goal, an assist, and a fight. A six-time Art Ross Trophy winner, he played 26 seasons with the Detroit Red Wings, retiring in 1971. After a two-year retirement, he returned to the fledgling WHA, to play with his sons on the Houston Aeros. He played his last NHL season at the age of 52 in 1980 with the Hartford Whalers, finishing as the NHL’s career points leader until 1989.\n\nMario Lemieux (1965–present): Born in Montreal, Quebec, “Super Mario” scored his first NHL goal on the first shift of his first game, against Boston in 1984. He led the Pittsburgh Penguins to consecutive Stanley Cups in 1991–1992. After a bout with Hodgkin’s disease, he returned to lead the NHL in scoring in 1995–1996 and 1996–1997. He then later helped bail the Penguins out of bankruptcy by becoming the lead owner of the team in 1999.\n\nBobby Orr (1948–present): Born in Parry Sound, Ontario, Bobby Orr revolutionized the position of defenseman. The first blue liner to win the Art Ross Trophy (scoring title), he also won the Norris (best defenseman), Hart (league MVP), and Conn Smythe (playoff MVP) in the same season (1969–1970). That same year, he led the Bruins to their first Stanley Cup in three decades with the now famous “Goal.” He recorded the highest ± rating ever for a single season, +124 in 1970–1971, and won eight straight Norris Trophies from 1968–1975. Unfortunately, his bad knees forced him into early retirement in 1979.\n\nMaurice Richard (1921–2000): Born in Montreal, Quebec, “The Rocket” was one of the most gifted offensive players in NHL history. He was the first NHL player to score 50 goals in a single season, doing so in 1944–1945, and also the first to score 500 goals in a career. The winner of eight Stanley Cups, his suspension by league president Clarence Campbell in 1955 led to “The Richard Riot” on March 17, 1955, which was quelled only by an appeal by Richard for peace. Many sociologists credit the Richard Riot with contributing to the rise of the Quebec independence movement. The NHL began awarding the Rocket Richard Trophy in 1999 for the league’s top regular-season goal scorer.\n\nTerry Sawchuk (1929–1970): Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, “Ukey” played more games (971), won more games (447), and recorded more shutouts (103) than any other netminder in NHL history. In 1952, he recorded eight straight wins, including four shutouts, in the playoffs for Detroit. Winning five Vezina Trophies in his career for lowest team GAA (the criteria during his era), Sawchuk also won the Calder Trophy as NHL rookie of the year in 1950–1951. Always deeply psychologically troubled, he died in a household accident in 1970 while a member of the New York Rangers.\n\nKen Dryden (1947–present): Born in Hamilton, Ontario, he had a standout career at Cornell University before joining the Montreal Canadiens organization in 1970. In 1970–1971, he starred in the playoffs, winning Conn Smythe Trophy honors (playoff MVP), before going on to win Calder Trophy (Rookie of the Year) honors the next season. Along with Tony Esposito, he served as Canada’s goalie during the legendary 1972 Summit Series with the USSR. He sat out the entire 1973–1974 season in a contract dispute, and worked as a legal clerk, obtaining his law degree from McGill. He currently serves as the President of the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nVladislav Tretiak (1952–present): Born in Moscow, USSR, Tretiak is the first Russian player in Hockey Hall of Fame. He came to North American prominence when he starred in 1972 Summit Series against Canada. A ten-time World Champion, he also won three gold medals (1972, 1976, and 1984). The decision to pull Tretiak after the first period of the U.S./USSR game in the 1980 Olympics is considered to be part of the reason the U.S. went on to win the gold. He played for CSKA Moscow (Central Red Army) for 15 years and, after retiring, served as the goaltending coach for the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nBobby Hull (1939–present): Born in Point Anne, Ontario; “The Golden Jet” was the star of the Chicago Blackhawks of the 1960s. He won three Art Ross Trophies and led the NHL in goals seven times. In June 1972, he defected to the fledgling WHA’s Winnipeg Jets for a record ten-year, $2.75 million deal, where he helped make Winnipeg one of the four WHA teams to merge with the NHL in 1978–1979. He is also the father of Brett Hull; the duo is the only father-son combination to score 500 each in NHL history.\n\nEddie Shore (1902–1985): Born in Fort Qu’Appele, Saskatchewan, “The Edmonton Express” is the epitome of “Old-Time Hockey,” as stated in the 1977 film Slap Shot. As a blue-liner for the Boston Bruins he was named a first-team NHL All-Star for eight of nine years during the 1930s, and is the only defenseman to win four Hart Trophies as NHL MVP. He later went on to be the owner/GM of the AHL’s Springfield Indians, and the anecdotes about his stingy ways are now hockey lore."

    "title": "Revolutionary War Generals",
    "content": "Benedict Arnold: Volunteering for service following the Battle of Lexington, he joined Ethan Allen in the attack on Fort Ticonderoga. Appointed by Washington to capture Quebec, he was severely wounded in the failed December 1775 assault that also saw the death of General Richard Montgomery. Arming a flotilla on Lake Champlain, he attacked the British forces at Valcour Island, earning accolades — perhaps at the cost of the support of other officers. Passed over for promotion, Washington personally persuaded him not to resign. Promoted following his defense of Danbury, he again considered resignation, but won victory at Ft. Stanwix, and commanded advance battalions at Saratoga, where he was wounded in the fight. Sent to command Philadelphia, he lived extravagantly among Loyalists, and skirted several regulations to raise money, prompting investigations. After marrying Peggy Shippen, he made overtures to the British, planning to betray his command of West Point. When his contact, Major John Andre was captured, he escaped. Later, as part of the British army he raided New London, Connecticut, and led several raids on Virginia.\n\nJohn Burgoyne: “Gentleman Johnny,” as he was known due to his cultural tastes (Burgoyne was also a playwright), he began his Revolutionary War career under Gage, returning to England after ineffectiveness in 1774–1775. Sent to reinforce Canada, he formulated a plan to isolate New England with the help of Barry St. Leger and William Howe. The plan worked as far as capturing Fort Ticonderoga, but met resistance when he sent his Hessians to attack Bennington. Exhausted, his troops met trouble at Saratoga, being repulsed at Freedman’s Farm, and being forced to surrender after Bemis Heights. Paroled on the condition he return to England, Burgoyne was later appointed commander-in-chief of Ireland.\n\nCharles Cornwallis, First Marquess Cornwallis: An aristocrat and ensign in 1756, he fought in the battle of Minden, and by the end of the Seven Years’ War he was a captain. Made aide-de-camp to George III, he made colonel, and was promoted to major general before being sent to America. After a failed assault on Charleston, he served under Sir Henry Clinton in the battle of Long Island, but made his mark in fighting at Manhattan and pursued Washington across the Hudson, being outmaneuvered by Washington at Princeton (January 3, 1777). Following this defeat he directed the main attack on Brandywine Creek, and reinforced Germantown as part of the plan to capture Philadelphia. Promoted to second-in-command under Clinton after the Philadelphia campaign, he led the Battle of Monmouth before returning home to attend his sick wife. Sent south in 1780 to capture Charleston, he bested Horatio Gates at Camden (South Carolina) and Nathanael Greene at Guilford Courthouse, the latter a pyrrhic victory that likely led to his defeat in attempts to contain Lafayette in Virginia. Following this, he occupied Yorktown in August 1781, where he was surrounded by American and French forces, and forced to surrender. Following the war, he was appointed governor-general of India, and proved to be a capable administrator.\n\nHoratio Gates: Wounded in the disastrous French and Indian War attack on Fort Duquesne, it was there he first met George Washington. Recommended by Washington to be adjutant general of the army at the outbreak of revolution, he organized the army around Boston into an effective force. Promoted to major general in 1776, he was assigned to command troops in New York originally intended to invade Canada. Briefly put in charge of Philadelphia, he then directed the defense of New York against Burgoyne’s invasion attempt, leading to victory at Saratoga. Following this he became involved in the Conway cabal, an attempt to replace Washington, which led to coldness between the two. Placed in command of the South over Washington’s objections by Congress, he tried to raise adequate forces, but lost the battle of Camden to Cornwallis, and was replaced by Nathanael Greene. Washington then accepted Gates back as his deputy, a position he held until the end of the war.\n\nSir Guy Carleton: Irish-born, he led grenadiers across the Plains of Abraham in the 1759 siege of Quebec under his close friend General James Wolfe. Carleton became governor of Quebec in 1768; at the time of the Intolerable Acts he sent troops from Canada to reinforce the British military presence in Boston. After the outbreak of war, Carleton repulsed Montgomery and Arnold’s attempt to seize Quebec City. In 1776 his naval forces defeated Arnold again at Valcour Island in Lake Champlain. Carleton resigned as governor after John Burgoyne arrived in Canada to lead the British expedition that met disaster at Saratoga. Sent back to Europe in June 1778, Carleton sat out all but the end of the war, returning in 1782 as commander-in-chief after Cornwallis’ surrender.\n\nNathanael Greene: A prominent Rhode Island politician prior to the revolution, he raised a militia company but was not elected their captain due to his partial lameness. Following his work in the siege of Boston, he marched his army to Long Island, where they aided in the battles around New York. Following the loss of Fort Washington, Greene led forces into victory at the Battle of Trenton, and then again distinguished himself by protecting Washington’s force at the Battle of Brandywine. Greene then led the main force at Germantown, and led the evacuation of positions along the Delaware River in fall 1777. The next year, Greene’s logistical talents led Washington to appoint him quartermaster general, a position he only accepted if he were allowed to retain field troops. He then led those troops as the right wing in the Battle of Monmouth. The quartermaster general position led to conflicts with the Continental Congress, and Greene resigned in 1780. Appointed to command to replace the traitor Benedict Arnold, he was sent south following Gates’ loss at Camden. Joining with Daniel Morgan, he retreated from Cornwallis’ forces for two months until a crippling counterattack at Guilford Courthouse, which gave a costly victory to the British. Until the end of the war, Greene led a spirited offensive against Lord Rawdon’s — and later Duncan Stuart’s — forces, besieging Augusta and Ninety-Six, and establishing headquarters in Charleston following Washington’s victory at Yorktown.\n\nSir William Howe: A veteran of the siege of Louisbourg, and the leader of the ascent to the Plains of Abraham (Quebec, 1759), he was dispatched in 1775 as second-in-command to Gage. After directing the attack on Bunker Hill, he succeeded Gage as commander, and coordinated a strategic retreat from Boston to Halifax. In Halifax, he coordinated a joint army-navy attack with his brother, Richard, an admiral, resulting in a campaign which allowed the British to control New York City. After his attempts to secure a peace in 1777 failed, he led the attack on Philadelphia, defeating Washington at Brandywine. After this, he wintered in Philadelphia, waiting for acceptance of his resignation, due to the failed peace negotiations. On May 25, 1778, he relinquished command to Sir Henry Clinton and returned home.\n\nTadeusz Kosciusko: After receiving military training in his native Poland and France, he resigned his commission due to poor advancement prospects. Offering his assistance to the Americans, he helped fortify the Delaware River in 1776, earning himself the rank of colonel. That winter, he planned the building of Fort Mercer, and the next spring headed north with General Gates, becoming an engineering advisor to the northern army and building fortifications that helped win the battle of Saratoga. In 1780, he worked on building defenses for West Point, then headed south when Gates was appointed command of the Southern Department. Serving under Nathanael Greene, he distinguished himself in the Race to the Dan River, and at Charleston, but mishandled the siege of Ninety-Six. Following the war, he was granted American citizenship but returned home to Poland. Back home he resisted partition, and attempted to liberate the nation afterward.\n\nMarquis de Lafayette: Approached by the U.S. Minister to France, Silas Deane, he arrived in April 1777 with Baron de Kalb. First seeing action at Brandywine, his primary early action was in supporting Washington during the winter at Valley Forge. After participating at the battles of Barren Hill, Monmouth, and Newport, he returned to France, raising support for an expeditionary force. Returning to America a colonel, he served on the board that sentenced Major Andre to death, and then faced Andre’s confederate Benedict Arnold in battle in 1781. Working in Virginia, he evaded Cornwallis’ forces, until reinforcements arrived in June. Coordinating with Anthony Wayne, the two combined forces against Cornwallis in the battle of Green Spring. Pursuing Cornwallis to Yorktown, Lafayette helped the siege there until Cornwallis’ surrender.\n\nFrancis Marion: Previously an Indian fighter, Marion was given command of Fort Sullivan in 1776. Commanding the 2nd South Carolina, he fought at Savannah, and escaped capture when the British retook Charleston. From there, Marion fought a successful guerilla campaign against British troops, forcing Cornwallis to appoint Colonel Banastre Tarleton to eliminate Marion. Tarleton’s frustration at the task led to the remark “But as for this damned old fox, the devil himself could not catch him,” creating Marion’s nickname, “Swamp Fox.” Promoted to brigadier general in 1781, and later given command of the North and South Carolina militias, Marion fought the British at Eutaw Springs.\n\nJohn Paul Jones: A Scotsman who had fled Britain after killing two people, he added the last name Jones to his given name, John Paul, to hide from law enforcement. At the outbreak of conflict, he was commissioned to outfit the Alfred, which he then used to help capture New Providence in the Bahamas. The next month, April 1776, he led the Alfred against the HMS Glasgow, leading him to promotion and command of the Providence. Ordered to raid until his provisions were expended, he sank and captured ships in operations along the Atlantic coast. Commissioned captain of the Ranger, he sailed to France to acquire new ships, and captured the HMS Drake. Leaving Europe in August 1779, he met the British ship Serapis in battle on September 23, 1779.\n\nBaron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben: Formerly part of Frederick the Great’s staff, the Prussian Steuben was recommended by Ben Franklin to George Washington. Accepted by the Continental Congress, Steuben joined Washington at Valley Forge, and began training the army. Appointed major general and inspector general in May 1777, he aided in the Battle of Monmouth, then spent two years writing the Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States, an army training manual. Sent to Virginia in 1780 to oppose Benedict Arnold’s actions, illness caused him to turn over his troops to Lafayette, but Steuben recovered in time to aid in the siege of Yorktown.\n\nGeorge Washington: Selected by the Continental Congress to serve as general-in-chief, his first actions were to blockade Boston. Key to the success in Boston was the capture of Dorchester Heights, allowing cannon fire against the British and forcing the withdrawal of Howe. After failing to defend New York, Washington retreated toward Pennsylvania, extending British supply lines and allowing a successful counterattack on Hessian mercenaries at Trenton. Following victory at Princeton, Washington retired to winter quarters at Morristown. Sending his best forces north to deal with Burgoyne’s attack in spring 1777, he kept Howe engaged in the mid-Atlantic. Autumn setbacks at Brandywine and Germantown led to a demoralized winter camp at Valley Forge, countered by the work of Lafayette, Steuben, and others. After a costly draw with Sir Henry Clinton’s forces at Monmouth, Washington sent Greene south to replace Gates, and worked with the French general Jean Baptiste Rochambeau to plan the Yorktown campaign. The success of this campaign led to Cornwallis’ surrender on October 19, 1781."

    "title": "Organelles",
    "content": "Nucleus: The nucleus is the “command central” of the cell because it contains almost all of the cell’s DNA, which encodes the information needed to make all the proteins that the cell uses. The DNA appears as chromatin through most of the cell cycle, but condenses to form chromosomes when the cell is undergoing mitosis. Within the nucleus there are dense bodies called nucleoli, which contain ribosomal RNA. In eukaryotes, the nucleus is surrounded by a selectively-permeable nuclear envelope.\n\nRibosomes: Ribosomes are the machines that coordinate protein synthesis, or translation. They consist of several RNA and protein molecules arranged into two subunits. Ribosomes read the messenger RNA copy of the DNA and assemble the appropriate amino acids into protein chains.\n\nMitochondria: The powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria are double-membrane-bound organelles that are the site of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, processes that produce energy for the cell in the form of ATP. The inner membrane of a mitochondrion forms folds called cristae, which are suspended in a fluid called the matrix. The mitochondrial matrix contains DNA and ribosomes.\n\nEndoplasmic reticulum: The ER is a network of tube-like membranes continuous with the nuclear envelope. Part of it are “rough” because they are covered in ribosomes, while other parts are “smooth” because they aren’t. In the ER, proteins undergo modifications and folding to yield the final, functional protein structures.\n\nGolgi apparatus: The stack of flattened, folded membranes that forms the Golgi apparatus acts as the “post office of the cell.” Here proteins from the ribosomes are stored, chemically modified, “addressed” with carbohydrate tags, and packaged in vesicles for delivery.\n\nLysosomes: Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles that contain digestive enzymes that break down proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. They are important in processing the contents of vesicles taken in from outside the cell. It is crucial to maintain the integrity of the lysosomal membranes because the enzymes they contain can digest cellular components as well.\n\nChloroplasts: Found only in plants and certain protists, the chloroplast contains the green pigment chlorophyll and is the site of photosynthesis. Like the mitochondrion, a chloroplast is a double-membrane-bound organelle, and it has its own DNA and ribosomes in the stroma. Chloroplasts contain grana, which are stacks of single membrane structures called thylakoids on which the reactions of photosynthesis occur.\n\nVacuoles: Found mainly in plants and protists, vacuoles are liquid-filled cavities enclosed by a single membrane. They serve as storage bins for food and waste products. Contractile vacuoles are important for freshwater protists to rid their cells of excess water that accumulates because of salt imbalance with the environment.\n\nCilia and flagella: Cilia and flagella are important organelles of motility, that is, they allow the cell to move. Flagella are long, whip-like structures, while cilia are short, hair-like projections. Both contain a 9 + 2 arrangement of microtubules in cross-section (two microtubules in the middle, nine pairs in a circle around the outside) and are powered by molecular motors of kinesin and dynein molecules.\n\nCentrioles: Not found in plant cells, centrioles are paired organelles with nine sets of microtubule triplets in cross section. They are important in organizing the microtubule spindle needed to move the chromosomes during mitosis."

    "title": "Kings Of France",
    "content": "Philip II (1165–1223, reigned 1179–1223; house of Capet): Philip was the first of the great Capetian kings of France. Fighting and negotiating against Henry II, Richard I, and John of England, Philip won back Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, and other territories. He also took part in the famous Third Crusade (with Richard I and Frederick Barbarossa) and made use of the Albigensian crusade to pave the way for the annexation of Languedoc by his successor.\n\nLouis VIII (1187–1226, reigned 1223–1226; house of Capet): Though he reigned for only three years, Louis’ contributions to the rise of French power were enormous. He annexed Languedoc and captured Poitou from England. Perhaps more importantly, he established the systems of appanages (land grants) which replaced the older, local nobles with barons who owed their fiefs to the crown. This allowed for the subsequent rise in French royal (and national) power.\n\nSt. Louis IX (1214–1270, reigned 1226–1270; house of Capet): Louis led the Seventh Crusade, which ended in military disaster, but after his ransoming he remained in the Holy Land to successfully negotiate for what he couldn’t win. He returned to Europe with his reputation intact and negotiated a peace with England under which Henry III become his vassal. He stabilized the French currency and is generally held to have reduced corruption in the kingdom. He died leading a crusade against Tunisia. St. Louis is the only canonized king of France.\n\nCharles V (1338–1380, reigned 1364–1380; house of Valois): Charles had an inauspicious start (before his reign even began) with having to ransom his father, John II, from England for three million crowns and most of southwestern France. Later, with military advisor Bertrand du Guesclin, he recaptured almost all of that territory. He also concluded alliances with Portugal, Spain, and Flanders, reorganized the army, and restructured the collection of taxes while leading France’s recovery from the devastation of the early period of the Hundred Years’ War.\n\nCharles VIII (1470–1498, reigned 1483–1498; house of Valois): Charles’ short reign is remarkable for the enormous cost in men and money of his Italian campaign, but more so for the number of his successors that followed his catastrophic lead. Charles was motivated by a desire to govern Naples, which he had theoretically inherited. He died before he could surpass or absolve his disastrous first campaign with another.\n\nFrancis I (1494–1547, reigned 1515–1547; house of Valois): Francis’s early military victories (like the Battle of Marignano), his lavish court, and his support of luminaries like Leonardo da Vinci augured a splendid reign. His rivalry with Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, however, spelled his doom. He was captured in battle in 1525 and held for a humiliating ransom. Wars continued after his release, but bankruptcy and religious strife laid France low.\n\nHenry III (1551–1589, reigned 1574–1589; house of Valois): Henry’s reign was suffused with blood, at first because of the continuous Wars of Religion that pitted Catholics against Huguenots, but later because of the struggles that arose when it became clear that he was going to be the last of the Valois line. The War of the Three Henries broke out after his brother died and the then-Protestant Henry of Navarre (later Henry IV) became heir, leading the Catholic Holy League to strike out of fear for its interests. Henry III was assassinated by a crazed friar in 1589.\n\nHenry IV (1553–1610, reigned 1589–1610; founder of the house of Bourbon): Henry, the king of Navarre, became the heir to the throne when Henry III’s brother died in 1584. After fighting Catholic opposition in the War of the Three Henries, he renounced Protestantism and accepted Catholicism (supposedly saying “Paris is well worth a mass”) to become king. With the help of Maximilien Sully he erased the national debt and removed much of the religious strife with the Edict of Nantes (1598).\n\nLouis XIII (1601–1643, reigned 1610–1643; house of Bourbon): Sometimes working with his chief minister Cardinal Richelieu and sometimes against, Louis XIII turned France into the pre-eminent European power during his reign. This was largely achieved via French victories in the Thirty Years’ War. The Three Musketeers is set in the early years of his reign.\n\nLouis XIV (1638–1715, reigned 1643–1715; house of Bourbon): Louis XIV’s reign is often cited as the best historical example of an absolute monarchy. Louis led France against most of the rest of Europe to win the throne of Spain for his grandson (the War of the Spanish Succession). He championed classical art, religious orthodoxy, and instituted a great program of building throughout France. Known as the “Sun King,” his 72-year reign is among the longest in recorded history."

    "title": "Economists",
    "content": "Adam Smith (Scottish, 1723–1790): Though he wrote on nearly every subject of moral and social philosophy, he is basically remembered as the author of An Inquiry into the nature and causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) and as the creator of the metaphor of the “invisible hand.” This work more-or-less single-handedly founded the Classical school of economics.\n\nMilton Friedman (American, 1912–2006): Conservative thinker famous for his advocacy of monetarism (a revision of the quantity theory of money) in works like A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963). He is strongly associated with the ideals of laissez-faire government policy.\n\nKarl Marx (German, 1818–1883): Also a historian and social philosopher, Marx’s principal contribution to economic thought was extending the labor theory of value to its logical conclusion, his theory of surplus value. This theory, along with his defense of historical materialism, appeared in Das Kapital (1867, 1885, 1894).\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes (English, 1883–1946): He is most famous for The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936), which judged most of classical economic analysis to be a special case (hence “General Theory”) and argued that the best way to deal with prolonged recessions was deficit spending.\n\nDavid Ricardo (English, 1772–1823): Ricardo is best known for Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, which introduced more-or-less modern notions of comparative advantage and its theoretical justification for unfettered international trade. He also put forth the so-called iron law of wages.\n\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith (Canadian, 1908–2006): His liberal popular writings like The Affluent Society and The New Industrial State (with their emphasis on public service and the limitations of the marketplace) ensure his coming up again and again.\n\nFrancois Quesnay (French, 1694–1774): Quesnay was the undisputed leader of the Physiocrats, the first systematic school of economic thought. Among its tenets were the economic and moral righteousness of laissez-faire policies and the notion that land is the ultimate source of all wealth.\n\nAlfred Marshall (English, 1842–1924): Marshall’s magnum opus, 1890’s Principles of Economics, introduced the notions of consumer surplus, quasi-rent, demand curves, and elasticity, all fundamental concepts in introductory macro- and microeconomics.\n\nThorstein Veblen (American, 1857–1929): Veblen is primarily remembered for his The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), which introduced phrases like “conspicuous consumption.” He is remembered for likening the ostentation of the rich to the Darwinian proofs of virility found in the animal kingdom.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (English, 1806–1873): Also a social philosopher, Mill is mainly known in economic circles today for his work extending the ideas of Ricardo in Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy (1844) (for example, the relationship between profits and wages), and also for exhaustively examining the necessity of private property in his Principles of Political Economy (1848)."

    "title": "Jewish Holidays",
    "content": "Rosh HaShanah: Celebrated on the first and second days of the month of Tishrei, Rosh HaShanah marks the beginning of the Jewish civil year. (The beginning of the ecclesiastic year is Pesach.) It is believed that on Rosh HaShanah, people’s souls are judged, and God “temporarily” decides their fate for the coming year. Between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur are the Ten Days of Repentance, when people are given a chance to reflect and repent. On Rosh HaShanah, it is customary to wear white clothes and eat apples with honey for a sweet year, and pomegranates to represent being as fruitful as its many seeds. Other customs include the blowing of the shofar (an instrument made from a ram’s horn) and a ceremony called Tashlich, in which Jews throw bread crumbs into running water to symbolize the cleansing of their sins.\n\nYom Kippur: Celebrated on the tenth day of Tishrei, it is the Jewish Day of Atonement; at the end of Yom Kippur, it is believed that one’s fate is sealed. Jews are required to abstain from eating, drinking, washing, and sex, as well as indulgent dress such as jewelry, make-up, and leather. One traditionally wears white clothes to symbolize purity. In the afternoon, the Book of Jonah is read. A full day of prayers begins with the Kol Nidre, which releases Jews from vows or promises to God. As on Rosh HaShanah, the shofar is blown unless it is Shabbat, in which case the shofar is blown only during the final service, N’ila (meaning “closing,” since the Temple gates were closed for this service).\n\nSukkot: Celebrated on the 15th of Tishrei, Sukkot commemorates the sukkot (booths) that the Israelites lived in following the Exodus from Egypt; it also celebrates the harvest. Traditionally, Jews build outdoor booths in which they live and eat for seven days. In synagogue, four symbolic species — the palm, a yellow citrus called the etrog, the myrtle, and the willow — are waved in seven directions. Each night, in the sukkah, it is traditional to invite a Biblical figure to be the guest for that night.\n\nHanukkah: This festival lasts for eight days, starting on the 25th day of Kislev (the third month). It celebrates the victory of the small Maccabee army against the large Greek army of Antiochus, and the Maccabees’ recapture and re-purification of the Temple in Jerusalem (c. 168 BC). When they did so, they found only a small amount of oil to light the menorah in the Temple, and it would take a week to make more; miraculously, the oil burned for the full week. To commemorate this, on each night, observers use a “helper candle” called the shamash to light candles in a menorah (more properly called a chanukiah, as a menorah only has six branches while a chanukiah has nine): one candle (besides the shamash) on the first night, two on the second night, and so on. Furthermore, it is traditional to eat foods fried in oil; in the United States, potato pancakes called latkes are popular; in Israel, fried jelly donuts called sufganiyot are more common. Children play a game with a spinning a top called the dreidel, which contains the Hebrew letters that form the initials of a phrase that translates as “a great miracle happened there” (in Israel, they say “a great miracle happened here”). Exchanging presents is only a recent tradition developed in the U.S. to make Jewish children feel less left out as their Christian peers get Christmas presents (or, if you are cynical, the tradition was invented by toymakers to sell more toys).\n\nPurim: Celebrated on the 14th of Adar (the sixth month) and commemorating the victory of the Jews — led by Esther and her cousin Mordechai — against Haman, who tried to destroy the Jews because of his anger at Mordechai. The story, recorded in the Book of Esther (read from a scroll, or megillah), takes place in Shushan, the capital city of the kingdom of the Persian King Ahasuerus (Achashvayrosh). On Purim, it is traditional to dress up, get drunk, give to charity, eat triangular pastries called hamentaschen (meaning “Haman’s ears” or “Haman’s pockets” in German), and exchange gifts (mishloach manot) with friends.\n\nPassover (Pesach): Celebrated for seven or eight days beginning on the 15th day of Nissan (the seventh month), Passover commemorates the Exodus from Egypt. It is also the ancient Hebrew New Year. On the first day or two days, Jews have a festival dinner called a seder, where they retell the story of the Exodus from a book called a hagaddah. Jews are required to abstain from eating or owning leavened bread, and anything made with leaven, for the duration of the festival; matzah (a flat unleavened bread) is eaten instead. On Passover, the Song of Songs is recited. Passover also begins a period of seven weeks called the Omer, a period of semi-mourning that leads into Shavuot.\n\nShavuot: Celebrated on the sixth day of Sivan (the ninth month), the 50th day of the Omer that began after Passover. The word Shavuot means “weeks,” (seven weeks of the Omer), hence the name of the homologous Christian holiday Pentecost. Shavuot commemorates the giving of the Torah to the Israelites at Mount Sinai, as well as the beginning of the harvest in ancient Israel. Sukkot, Passover, and Shavuot are the three pilgrimages, when Jews would all gather at the Temple each year; on Shavuot, Jews would dedicate their first harvest fruits to the Temple. The Book of Ruth is read in synagogue on Shavuot, and it is traditional to study all night on this festival.\n\nTisha b’Av (the Ninth of the month Av): This is a day of mourning for the destructions of the First and Second Temples, as well as a number of other calamities in Jewish history. It is traditional to fast and to keep oneself in a solemn mood. The Book of Lamentations is read in a mournful tone, traditionally while sitting on the floor and with candles as the only lights."
